This page intentionally left blank INTRODUCTION David Hume 76 was one of the great philosophers arguably the greatest of that prodigiously fruitful era known as the early modern period. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries scholastic Aristotelianism a worldview which had dominated thought for many hundreds of years nally began to be overshadowed by a recogniz ably modern scientic perspective. Ren Descartes building on the discoveries of Galileo Galilei and others was the rst philosopher seriously to threaten Aristotles dominance. Then in the next generation John Locke developed a rival account of the world incorporating scientic developments from England associated particularly with Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton. By the end of the seventeenth century scholasticism was in terminal decline but intense debate continued as philosophers sought to make sense of the world and mans place in it accommodating the new discoveries. Some of the points in dispute were essentially scientic but many others concerned what we would now call epistemology i.e. Both Descartes and Locke found ways of tying these threads together and they were followed by others such as respectively Nicolas Malebranche and George Berkeley who later developed their theories in novel ways. Despite this variety of speculation these thinkers all shared some important assumptions notably a view of the world as created by divine reason andrelatedlyas potentially intelligible to human reason. Humes special signicance is as the rst great philosopher to question both of these pervasive assumptions and to build an episte mology and philosophy of science that in no way depend on either of them. Over a century before Charles Darwins Origin of Species of Hume argued powerfully that human reason is fundamentally similar to that of the other animals founded on instinct rather than quasidivine insight into things. Hence science must proceed by exper iment and systematization of observations rather than by metaphys ical theorizing or a priori speculation. This outlook revolutionary in its time was to be powerfully vindicated during the twentieth century as the successes of relativity theory and quantum mechanics forced scientistsoften very reluctantly to accept that intuitive unintel ligibility to human reason is no impediment to empirical truth. Humes once scandalous message has thus become almost scientic common sense. Outside the laboratory however we still inhabit a world infused with ancient assumptions and largely blind to the need for or the consequences of their abandonment. So Humes attempt to forge an empirically based naturalistic worldview retains a unique contemporary relevance. Humes rst Publication a Treatise of Human Nature 40 began as an attempt to introduce the experimental method of rea soning into moral subjects. But in both advocating and pursuing the empirical study of the human world the juvenile Hume was carryd away by the Heat of Youth Invention see p. 63 producing a long work in which his strokes of critical genius were confusingly mingled with unrealistically ambitious psychological generalizations andat least in Book Iunresolved sceptical paradoxes. Hume quickly regretted this as his letters testify and even before the nal Book III of the Treatise was delivered from the press he was already reformu lating his approach in the short Abstract included in this volume as Appendix I. By he had produced a second major work the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding1 following the pattern of the Abstract in focusing on his central philosophical mes sage expanding and clarifying the key arguments that support it for example in Sections IV VII and VIII and limiting his psycho logical speculations to modest hints of explications and analogies E 5.9. The sceptical paradoxes are also limited or mitigated but this perhaps surprisingly gives the Enquiry more rather than less critical bite. Anyone who reads the Treatisewith its radical suggestions that even our trust in logic is illfounded and that even our basic beliefs in external objects and the self are incoherentmay be puzzled but is unlikely to be convinced. If everything is equally doubtful then most people will hang on to what is comfortable and though radical scepti cism may do something to jolt the complacent dogmatist it is unlikely to yield any settled change of mind. The Enquiry is more potent because more discriminating. It reveals the relatively humble basis of Introduction x 1 Called the rst Enquiry to distinguish it from the Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals. Introduction xi human reason in much the same way as Book I of the Treatise but instead of going on to advocate ever more radical forms of scepticism it then takes human reason seriously for what it is and builds on it a persuasive structure that can vindicate disciplined modern science while condemning traditional metaphysics and irrational superstition. The magnitude of Humes achievement is best appreciated by surveying the depth of the tradition he undermined stretching back to the beginnings of philosophy in ancient Greece. Although as we shall see the early modern world into which he was born had already rejected much of its medieval dogmatic legacy that legacy was replaced with a new dogmatism which was less obvious because so pervasive. Having identied the common threads that linked the ancient medieval and early modern worlds we shall then be in a position to turn with more appreciation to the pages of the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding one of the very nest works of philosophy and the authoritative statement of David Humes mature epistemology. From Ancient to Modern Cosmology Aristotle was supremely honoured in the medieval period because his philosophical outlook could be comfortably combined with Christianity a synthesis impressively rened by Thomas Aquinas 74. The Christianization of the Roman Empire had long since brought about the suppression of all the pagan schools of philosophy that had thrived in ancient Greece such as the Academic and Pyrrhonian sceptics the Epicureans and the Stoics.2 These rival traditions were then largely forgotten until the Renaissance when pagan manuscripts that had been preserved in the Greek or Muslim worlds were brought west by scholars eeing the Ottoman Turks. Suddenly a range of new intellectual horizons opened up combining with other events to prompt a general questioning of traditional authority. Population growth technological innovation notably gunpowder and the dis covery of new lands cultures and religions unknown to the ancients 2 The Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered the destruction of pagan temples including great libraries such as that in Alexandria in 391 the emperor Justinian then suppressed all the remaining pagan schools in 529. For a brief review of the various philosophical traditions mentioned here see the Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers and Philosophical Movements below. Likewise the Glossary can be consulted for un familiar technical terms or antiquated meanings. Introduction xii all provoked political economic and doctrinal instability. Finally the Reformation starting with Martin Luthers rebellion against the Church of Rome in led to widespread religious wars founded on philosophical dierences one side took Church authority and tradition as the criterion of truth the other appealed instead to the Spirit of God acting within the individual believer. Suddenly traditional authority looked open to doubt and the questions of the rediscovered ancient sceptics became highly relevant inspiring natural philosophers i.e. Aristotelian physics and cosmology was based on the idea that material things have natural movements according to their elemental composition. The four terrestrial elements earth water air and re of which everything below the Moon is composed strive to reach their natural place in the cosmos earth at the centre water in a sphere around the earth then air and re. Stones thus naturally fall towards the centre of the universe because they mainly consist of earth while re rises. Heavenly bodies such as the stars however are seen to move perpetually in circles around the Earth implying that they are made of a fth element a celestial ether which Aristotle took to be some kind of crystalline solid. Again these movements are driven by a tele ological i.e. Around the Earth at the centre of the universe the Moon planets Sun and stars are arranged in a series of concentric crystalline shells forming a heavenly clockwork driven by the steady rotation of the outermost sphere repeating its circuits eternally with perfect accuracy while generating the dance of the plan ets as seen in the sky. However the visible motion of the planets is in fact very far from being a steady circular movement around the sky sometimes a planet will regress for a time moving backwards from day to day before turning again to continue in its usual direction. Accounting for this observed complexity requires much more than a simple pattern of circular orbits and over the years the Aristotelian model was progressively rened most notably with the addition of epicycles or orbits around orbits. It eventually achieved denitive form through the work of Ptolemy around ad 150 and was then destined to dominate European astronomy for almost 1500 years. In Nicolaus Copernicus famously advanced the theory that the Earth is a planet orbiting the Sun but it was not until the early Introduction xiii seventeenth century that observational evidence became available to mount a decisive challenge to Ptolemaic astronomy. In 10 Galileo Galilei made his own telescope a device invented only in and viewed the heavens in unprecedented detail immediately publishing what he saw in The Starry Messenger.3 Amongst his discov eries were craters mountains and valleys on the moon whose dimen sions could even be gauged from the observed shadows and whose existence suggested a world much like our own of rugged rocky irregularity rather than smooth etherial perfection. Likewise the four Galilean moons orbiting around Jupiter undermined the idea that all celestial motion must centre on the Earth while the sequence of the phases of Venus in shapes from crescent to almost circularinvisible to the naked eye but very obvious through a telescopegave decisive evidence against the AristotelianPtolemaic model of the planetary orbits. Less decisive but imaginatively suggestive of the need for a new worldview Galileo saw innumerable new stars of varying bright ness seeming to stretch out well beyond the crystalline sphere that was supposed to hold the known visible stars. From Aristotelian to Cartesian Intelligibility If the Earth is not at the centre of the universe then not only Aristotles cosmology but also his account of terrestrial motion must be seri ously in error. Moreover when tested critically specic predictions derived from his theories were found to be quite wrong even applied to such everyday things as the ight of a cannon ball a sledge sliding over an icy pond the dripping of water from a gutter or the fall of stones of dierent sizes. Galileo is reputed to have demonstrated this publicly by dropping a heavy and a light ball simultaneously from the Tower of Pisa both falling with similar speed.4 He went on to develop 3 Galileos werent the only relevant observations. In Tycho Brahe had observed a supernova and in Johannes Kepler observed another also seen by Galileo. Meanwhile in a major comet appeared which Braheby triangulation against observations of astronomers elsewhere in Europeproved to be more distant than the Moon. All these indi cated that the heavens beyond the Moon were far from the eternally incorruptible domain envisaged by Aristotle who had dismissed comets and meteors as atmospheric phenomena hence the word meteorology. See p. 60 below for Humes comment on the signicance of this undermining of the distinction between the heavenly and earthly domains. Aristotle claimed that heavy objects fall faster than light ones in proportion to their weight whereas in fact they usually fall faster only very marginally the dierence being Introduction xiv an alternative theory of motion based on the concepts of inertia and forces. This was taken further by Ren Descartes or Des Cartes widely considered the rst great early modern philosopherand it was his Cartesian mechanics that was to dominate the thought of much of the seventeenth century. Galileo and Descartes between them established a new way of under standing the physical world replacing purposive strivings what Aristotle had called nal causes by mathematically formulated laws framed exclusively in terms of mechanical ecient causation. The new science took bodies to be essentially passive their movement changing according to the action of external forces. Left to themselves bodies will simply maintain their state of rest or uniform linear motion this socalled inertia applying equally whether the body is stationary or moving in any direction so the concept of natural place or direction is completely abandoned. A bodys motion changes only when it is acted upon by a force though the precise magnitude of the force associated with changes of movement remained a matter of controversy.5 Descartess vision of mechanics had an elegant simplicity and also a reassuring air of intelligibility. In place of Aristotles ve elements with their somewhat arbitrary natural tendencies Descartes substi tuted a single type of matter whose essence i.e. All the fundamental properties of matter then supposedly follow logically from this essence in a way intelligible to our rational and immaterial minds for example extension implies no power of initiating change so matters passivity and inertia are fully explained.6 This approach also provided an ingenious solution to the resulting problem of accounting for the motion of the planets as well as cannon balls. If the essence of matter is extension then empty spacethat is extension due to air resistance. In David Scott of Apollo 15 performed Galileos experiment on the Moon showing that a hammer and a feather indeed fall at the same rate in the absence of air. The socalled vis viva controversy is alluded to by Hume in the Enquiry at E 7.29 endnot. This is of course only a brief caricature of Descartess position. He was far less ration alist about the practical conduct of scientic enquiry viewing experiment as the means of discovering which mechanisms are actually operative in nature. Note also that he sees mind as a substance quite distinct from matter whose essence is thought rather than extension. For a typically forthright Humean dismissal of such substance dualism see the beginning of his essay Of the Immortality of the Soul Appendix II below. Introduction xv without matterbecomes an impossibility so the entire universe must be lled with matter i.e. But in such a plenum movement of one piece of matter can happen only if another piece moves out of the way and as soon as it itself moves its place must be taken by yet another piece of matter. Hence all motion through space must involve matter moving in circuits and Descartes concluded that the universe must be structured by vor tices or whirlpools of circulating matter. This provides a very elegant explanation of how the planets can be retained in circular motion around the Sun despite their inertial tendency to move in straight lines. The Sun is thus the centre of a giant vortex with smaller vortices within it ranging from that which carries the Moon around the Earth down to the minuscule vortices in our own bodies that constitute the mechanisms of these intricate machines. Aristotelian physics had likewise aspired to make the operations of nature intelligible by explaining the behaviour of things in purposive terms but such explanations now came to seem vacuous compared with those of the new science. This is the point of Molires clever parody in Act III of his play le Malade imaginaire I would like to ask you the cause and reason why opium makes one sleep. The reason is that in opium resides a dormitive virtue of which it is the nature to stupefy the senses. Here the appeal to dormitive virtue is clearly no more than giving a fancy name to an unknown cause of the observed phenomenon. Any appearance of explanation is entirely bogus and most natural philosophers understandably became anxious to distance themselves from such occult qualities. They accordingly aimed to conne their explanations to ecient rather than nal causation i.e. All this helps to account for the great inuence of Cartesian physics which operated exclusively by means of mechanical causation interaction between contiguous parts of matter by pressure and impact. Such causation has a reassuring familiarity since its action can be observed amongst everyday things such as water and billiard balls and also an apparent intelligibility in that it operates through physical touching which requires only familiar Introduction xvi geometrical properties. Hence the appeal of this sort of mechanical philosophy was not conned to the followers of Descartes. Corpuscularianism Locke and Newton a less rationalistic form of mechanism was inspired by the atomism of the ancient Epicurean school and championed initially by the Frenchman Pierre Gassendi. However it ourished better in Britain whose natural philosophers tended to be suspicious of the Cartesian attempt to derive scientic principles from pure reason and followed Francis Bacon in emphasizing the role of experimentation. Robert Boyle one of the most inuential scientists of the seventeenth century7 advocated what he called corpuscularianism a name that avoided the atheistic associations of Epicurean atomism. Boyles interest in chemistry led him to speculate that material substances are composed of imperceptible corpuscles whose physical interactions on the atomic scale are responsible for the largescale perceived properties. All cor puscles are formed from the same universal matter and the various properties of dierent substances arise from the way in which these minute corpuscles are organized their individual size shape and motion and the resulting texture. It is only these socalled primary qualities that feature in the physical theory and they are to be distin guished from secondary qualities such as an objects colour taste or smell which represent the eects of the object on the human senses rather than anything genuinely intrinsic to it. Because the pri mary qualities are essentially geometrical and hence mathematically describable this theorylike that of Descartesheld out the promise of explaining objects behaviour in terms of straightforward mechan ical interactions whose results could potentially be calculated. But unlike Descartes Boyle took matters fundamental properties to include impenetrability as independent of extension. This opened the possi bility of penetrable extension i.e. Boyles corpuscularianism became philosophical orthodoxy in Britain through the work of his friend John Locke a philosopher destined to 7 It seems that Boyle was a major focus of natural philosophy teaching in Edinburgh when Hume studied there in 5. Introduction xvii eclipse Descartes and whose epistemology and political theory were to exert huge inuence into the nineteenth century and beyond. Lockes monumental Essay concerning Human Understanding published in explored the materials and limits of human thinking setting an agenda that Hume would follow in his similarly titled Enquiry. Lockes Essay is infused with an empiricist spirit arguing that all our ideas i.e. Locke starts with a vigorous attack on the theory of innate ideas targeting both scholastic and Cartesian attempts to deduce truths by pure reason based on such supposed ideas as for example in Descartess argument that the perfection of our innate idea of God implies a perfect cause. Locke then goes on to give a thoroughly empiricist account of the origin of our ideas taking an atomistic approach in which complex ideas are composed of simples and the simple ideas themselves are directly derived from experience. This experience can be of the external world or of our own minds thus the senses yield ideas of sensation such as the redness of a rose while introspection yields ideas of reection such as desire for the rose or fear of its thorn. Since all such expe rience is of particular sensations or feelings the ideas we derive from these are particular also. General ideas such as the idea of redness in general then get generated from ideas of particular instances e.g. If all our ideas are derived from experience then it is natural also to see this as the source of all our knowledge of the world since only our senses can inform us what kinds of things exist and how they behave. Thus Locke like Boyle was far more cautious than Descartes who had claimed to know the entire essence of matter and mind from his innate ideas of extension and thought respectively. For Locke the essence of both is hidden from us and the most we can do is to seek a plausible account of them which will always remain uncertain and answerable to further experience. It is in this spirit that he endorses the corpuscularian hypothesis that material things are made of cor puscles of substance in general Boyles universal matter possessing the geometrical primary properties size shape motion etc. Since we cannot know the Introduction xviii real essence of physical substancese.g. Science must therefore proceed by careful observation and experiment with little point to theorizing about underlying essences. Occasionally Locke seems to go further than these modest principles would allow sug gesting that the mechanical behaviour of the corpuscular world could in principle be predicted without experiment if only we had senses sucient to inspect it in detail I doubt not but if we could discover the Figure Size Texture and Motion of the minute Constituent parts of any two Bodies we should know without Trial several of their Operations one upon another as we do now the Properties of a Square or a Triangle. Essay IV. 5 But this remains at most a theoretical speculation and unlike Descartes Locke never expresses any serious ambition to deduce physical laws by pure reason. Descartess ambition exceeded his reach and although his thought remained inuential for many years especially in his native France its practical value never matched its theoretical elegance. The sup posed deduction of precise laws of motion from the pure geometry of extension proved elusive and Cartesian mechanics was unable to yield convincing predictions either of terrestrial dynamics e.g. Indeed the careful observations and calculations of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler had revealed these orbits to be elliptical rather than circular and this gave particular diculties for the Cartesian vortex theory. Its death knell came in when Isaac Newton was able in his Principia Mathematica to prove results indicating the impos sibility of a vortex yielding elliptical motion. The Principia perhaps the most inuential work of science ever published went on to dis place the Cartesian account by formulating a set of mechanical laws that apparently explained both terrestrial and celestial dynamics in exquisite detail. Newton retained Descartess concept of inertia as his rst law that objects move uniformly unless acted upon by a force but followed Boyle in replacing the Cartesian plenum with a universe mainly composed of empty space. He then took the controversial Introduction xix step of positing a force called gravity acting between bodies across that empty space proportional to their mass and inversely propor tional to the square of the distance between them. Using his newly invented mathematical tool the calculus he proved that such a force acting on bodies in accordance with his second law8 would indeed generate elliptical orbital motion amongst bodies in space and could also explain the parabolic ight and accelerating fall of projectiles near the Earth. Moreover the constant of proportionality required in these two contexts turned out to coincide strongly conrming both the theory itself and also Galileos once revolutionary claim that celestial and terrestrial bodies are subject to exactly the same laws. Despite this success Newtons postulated gravitational force acting at a distance and without any intermediate mechanical connexion seemed to many to be deeply unintelligible and even objectionably occult. Newtons inuential response to this objection in the second edition of Principia was to insist that he feigned no hypotheses i.e. If his equations correctly described the observed behaviour of objects then his theory including its postulated forces should be deemed acceptable whatever the underlying reality might be and speculation about the ultimate cause of gravitational attraction was both unnecessary and inappropriate unless and until further empir ical evidence emerged that might help to throw light on the matter. This somewhat instrumentalist position was later to make a deep impres sion on Hume whose approach to the metaphysics of causation can be seen as generalizing it to all causes whatever.9 Amongst natural philosophers however although Newtons theory triumphed owing to its sheer accuracy and predictive power the quest for intelligibility 8 This law states that if a force F acts on a body of mass m this causes the body to acceleratei.e. Instrumentalism is the view that theoretical entities such as forces are to be thought of as useful instruments for describing and predicting phenomena whose value does not depend on their actually corresponding to anything in the real world. Strict instrumen talists e.g. Berkeley deny such entities reality. What we might call methodological instrumentalists e.g. Newton in respect of gravity see the primary criterion of a theorys scientic adequacy as being independent of whether such entities exist. Humes position on powers and forces is methodologically instrumentalist in spirit but with a semantic colouring that interprets what it means for a power to exist in terms of its instrumental ist adequacy. Introduction xx continued and even Newton himself speculated that gravity might be accounted for by some sort of etherial active uid permeating space as mentioned by Hume at E 7.25 endnot. However there are also hints in his writings made louder and more explicit in his followers that the very unintelligibility of gravity has religious signicance as an argument for Gods existence since only the con tinuous power of an almighty being could keep the world working in conformity with a law for which there is no conceivable mechanical explanation. Free Will and the Dangers of Infidelity Throughout this period religion exerted a profound inuence over all philosophical and scientic speculation. No philosopher or scien tist could aord to ignore the religious implications of his work and many were attacked on account of their supposed heresy or indelity. Galileos punishment by the Inquisition provides the most famous example deemed heretical for stating that the Earth orbits the Sun and thus contradicting scriptural texts such as The Lor . . Hearing of Galileos condemnation Descartes withheld his own projected treatise The World and took great pains to exclude anything unorthodox from his published writings. But this did not save his works from being added in to the Roman Catholic Index of Prohibited Books a list that came to include almost every signicant work of postmedieval Western philosophy. His oence seems to have been an implicit denial of the doctrine of transubstan tiation that in the ceremony of the Eucharist commemorating the Last Supper consecrated bread and wine are literally changed in substance into the body and blood of Christ. Such a claim made some sense within the Aristotelian scheme but ceased to be feasible within a physics such as Descartess or Lockes that saw the perceptible second ary qualities of things their colour taste smell etc. Another theological mineeld raising problems for both Roman Catholics and Protestants concerned the question of free will. The growth of empirical science and the mechanical philosophy in Introduction xxi particular put increasing emphasis on laws of nature and the clockwork predictability of physical phenomena. Hence most of the great philoso phers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries e.g. Descartes Hobbes Spinoza Locke Leibniz Hume and Kant were attracted to determinism the view that every event is brought about by antecedent causes and is therefore predictable at least in principle from knowl edge of prior conditions and the relevant causal laws. But while deter minism in the physical realm was relatively unproblematic in the human realm it threatened to undermine freedom and moral respon sibility. Punishment seems appropriate only when some wrong is com mitted freely by an agent who had some choice in the matter. How then could it be right for any judge human or divine to punish a wrongdoer if the act in question was the product of inexorable causal laws and could have been foreseen by God with absolute certainty before the sinner had even been born Many shied away from facing up to this thorny problem Descartes for example is rather vague about whether determinism applies to the immaterial mind. The classic resolution of the dilemma compatibilism was most clearly formulated by his contemporary Thomas Hobbes the rst great philosopher to write in the English language and a forthright materialist who provocatively cited Descartess mental immaterial substance as a paradigm contradiction in terms. Accepting that the purely material world is governed by causal necessitation what he called the doctrine of necessityHobbes preserved moral freedom by asserting its full compatibility with determinism Liberty or Freedome signieth properly the absence of Opposition by Opposition I mean external Impediments of motio . . Liberty and Necessity are Consisten . . Leviathan ch. 1 Hume is widely seen as following Hobbes here and indeed uses Hobbesian terminology in Section VIII of the Enquiry Of Liberty and Necessity where he presents his own subtly dierent compat ibilist approach. Compatibilism is now very widely accepted though it remains controversial and the nexus of problems surrounding free willone Introduction xxii of the most ancient in metaphysicsis still hotly debated today. However three hundred years ago it seemed even more intractable because of the variety of theological issues with which it interlocked. Thus for example not only causal determinism but also Gods cre ation and sustaining of the world from moment to moment an idea much emphasized by Descartes threatens to make Him responsible for everything that happens including human sin. Denying deter minism might ameliorate this diculty but would potentially cast doubt on both Gods omnipotence by implying that some things happen by chance independently of His decrees and His omnis cience by making it utterly obscure how God could foresee a yet undetermined future. Another related issue involved the theology of grace and justication sharpened by Protestant Reformers empha sis on the original sin we inherit from Adam and Eve and our con sequent total depravity that makes us alleven the most apparently virtuousthoroughly deserving of eternal damnation. Following Augustine the Reformers insisted that we can be saved from this fate only by the grace of God which generously grants us salvation through faith in Christ and not through any merit of our own.10 But how is it that some achieve this saving faith whereas others do not given that the distinction cannot be founded on their moral virtue It seems that God must Himself choose on whom to bestow it but then if He does so how can this divine grace be anything other than irresistible Considerations like these led many Protestantsmost notably John Calvinto the doctrine of predestination implying that the choice of who is destined to go to heaven and who to hell was made by God from the beginning of time quite irrespective of human merit. Opponents of Calvinism found this doctrine morally monstrous whereby most of mankind including Christians of rival sects are doomed to inevitable hellre owing to the sin of Adam while God who could very easily spare all of them from this eternal torture simply by granting them saving faithin fact spares only very few. With eternal hellre or salvation at stake it is not surprising that religious disputes could become impassioned and aggressive. Hume himself living in Calvinist Scotland accordingly took care to avoid overt indelity for example suppressing his own potentially incendiary 10 The Roman Catholic Jansenists who make an appearance in Section X of the Enquiry took a similar approach though most Catholic sects put greater emphasis on good works as also contributing to salvation. Introduction xxiii treatment of immortality to be published only posthumously.11 Although religious persecution in Britain had greatly declined after the horrors of the Civil War 51 and the bigotry of Cromwells Commonwealth 60 it was still possible in for Thomas Aikenhead a 19yearold Edinburgh University student to be hanged for blasphemous comments made to other students and even as late as the Cambridge theologian Thomas Woolston died in prison having been convicted of blasphemy four years earlier. Hume him self experienced prejudice of a less dangerous kind being rejected as an applicant for a chair of Philosophy at Edinburgh in on the ground that his Treatise of Human Nature advocated Principles lead ing to downright Atheism le 17 even though the Treatise for rea sons of prudence contained no explicit discussion of religion. In the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland debated a motion to excommunicate him i.e. By then such a condemnation might well have made the Church a laughing stock but it was still prudent for Hume to tread carefully where Christianity was con cerned and an explicit denial of its central doctrines would be very likely both to provoke a hostile reaction and also to upset numerous friends. Even in eighteenthcentury Edinburgh the Athens of the North which saw the brilliant owering of intellectual activity of which Hume was a leading light religious orthodoxy remained a potent force and a centre of allegiance for the vast majority. Gods Design and Human Reason Amongst the more sophisticated classes of this Scottish Enlightenment however the nature of religious commitment was profoundly dierent from either of the types that had been dominant in the seventeenth century. Roman Catholicism with its ornate rites magical transub stantiation and saintly miracles was now commonly dismissed as superstition while the narrow bigotry and fervent enthusiasm of various Protestant sects was equally despised.12 Repelled by the vicious 11 For examples of Humes other methods of hiding or disguising his atheism see below pp. 2 Accordingly Humes essay Of Superstition and Enthusiasm in which he critically discusses them both could safely be published i. Introduction xxiv religious wars that these competing movements had inspired enlight ened intellectuals had moved on to a form of Christianity that fully embraced the scientic revolution with an increasing emphasis on religion as grounded on reason rather than faith. Thus the ancient God of miracles grace exclusive revelations and inexplicable mysteries was largely abandoned in favour of the Great Designer. Specically Christian doctrines such as the incarnation and resurrection of Jesus were as always based on written revelation with the miracles reported in the Bible playing a crucial role in authenticating both Jesus him self and other biblical gures. But any more recent or controversial revelations with their divisive doctrinal implications were downplayed in favour of an emphasis on natural theology religion as established by reason and science. From this perspective the incomparable Mr. Newton as Locke described him had performed a major ser vice to theology by revealing the secrets of Gods wonderful creation. Hence the famous epitaph by the poet Alexander Pope Nature and Natures laws lay hid in night God said Let Newton be and all was light. Unlike many thinkers in both earlier and later centuries those of the Enlightenmentat least in Britaintypically saw no conict between science and religion but viewed new discoveries as providing yet more evidence of the intricacy wisdom and benevolence of Gods handiwork. Science became a religiously informed activity and read ing Gods works from the great book of nature was judged a worthy alternative to reading them from the Bible. The Design Argument for Gods existence thus became widely viewed as the strongest pillar of natural religion.13 With God portrayed as the Great Designer and human reason demonstrating its own impressive powers in revealing His creation this naturally encouraged the thought that our faculty of reason has a semidivine quality substantiating the biblical claim that we are made in the image of God. Much of our behaviour might be instinct ive or driven by bodily appetites and passions like that of the other animals. But our reason seemed to be special providing an insight into rational truth most obviously in mathematics that appears to approximate to Gods transparent perception. Of course we are 13 For one of the most famous and elegant statements of the Design Argument see Part ii of Humes Dialogues in Appendix III below. Introduction xxv limited creatures so our pure rational insight may not extend very far but the apparent success of philosophers in discovering intelli gible laws of nature indicated that it was at least partially applicable beyond mathematics to the operations of the physical world. Locke typically was more modest acknowledging that even our scientic understanding of the world is at best probable and thus inevitably falls short of the demonstrative certainty of mathematics. But even this mere probable judgement is quite sucient for our practical needs and our faculty of reason is just as valuable when we use it to perceive probabilities as when we perceive certainties. God has given us faculties suitable for our position in the world as creatures inter mediate between animals and angels. And though our reason might be fallible and limited it above all is what elevates us above the beasts. In this at least most early modern philosophers could agree with Plato who saw reason as the central function of the immortal soul and even Aristotle who dened man as the one distinctive rational animal. Inertness Malebranche and Berkeley The Design Argument was not the only way in which the new science could be harnessed to the benet of religion. Indeed we saw earlier how the unintelligible nature of gravitational attractionthe fact that it seemed inexplicable in mechanistic termscould be presented as an argument for Gods existence. The mechanical philosophy not only encouraged the perception of the world as a clockwork master piece thereby implying the existence of a master clockmaker it also implied limits on the essence and powers of matter which could be exploited for theological gain. Descartes was the rst to do this when he claimed to perceive clearly and distinctly that the essence of matter was dierent from that of the thinking self so that the soul must be immaterial and hence could potentially survive the bodys dissolution. Locke followed giving an argument for the existence of God which depended on the impossibility of intelligent thoughts arising from the mere primary qualities of matter. However Locke ventured the opinion that God might if He wished superadd thought to matter Essay IV. This provoked a great deal of hostility since thought was evidently an active power whereas the mechani cal philosophy inspired by the concept of inertia encouraged the Introduction xxvi idea that matter was purely passive or inert. Material things were seen as intricate but lifeless machines their cogs and levers static until set in motion by some external power. This picture would be under mined if a genuinely active powersuch as thought or possibly gravitywere to be ascribed to matter itself. In that case the appar ent need for an external source of power might be removed with potentially dangerous implications for the existence of both God and a distinct immaterial soul. So the inertness of matter became a prominent and theologically charged theme in much philosophical discussion and was to remain so well into Humes time e.g. Some metaphysicians took these sorts of considerations much fur ther to the extent of completely denying the causal relevance of matter or even its very existence. Nicolas Malebranche the most inuential Cartesian of the late seventeenth century built on Descartess idea that continual recreation by God is necessary to sustain the world from moment to moment drawing the conclusion that no real causal interaction takes place except through the intervention of God. On this account when one billiard ball hits another the second ball moves not because of any force in the rst ball but purely because God then chooses to recreate the second ball in an appropriate sequence of positions. The collision of the balls is not a cause of the movement but an occasion for God to bring about the relevant behav iour in accordance with the behavioural laws that He has decreed. Hence this theory described and criticized by Hume at E 7.215 is called occasionalism. Another of Malebranches arguments for this theory was based on the common assumptiondiscussed above that genuine causation should be intelligible. Interpreting intelligibil ity in a particularly strong sense he insisted that an event can be a real cause only if it makes the subsequent nonoccurrence of its eect inconceivable so that the cause has a logically necessary connexion with its eect. Hence the collision of the rst billiard ball with the second cannot possibly be the real cause of the second balls motion because it would be perfectly conceivable for the one event not to be followed by the other. The only cause capable of satisfying this inconceivability requirement turns out to be the will of God who is omnipotent and whose intentions are therefore infallibly fullled. So again we reach Malebranches desired conclusion that God is the only true cause. Introduction xxvii Malebranches occasionalism has the peculiar consequence that every event in the world is really brought about by God and this applies to the operation not only of inanimate things but also of our own sensory and motor faculties. When we see an apple for exam ple or when we stretch to pick it up it is God who creates our visual perceptions which are of ideas in His mind to correspond with the reality and it is He who moves our arm or strictly recreates it moment by moment in changing positions to correspond with our willed movement. But having gone this far there might now seem little point in postulating a material world at all since it does not appear to play any part in what we experience or in explaining what happens e.g. On this view material objects exist only in so far as we have ideas in our mind that appear to rep resent them or God has ideas in His mind that are archetypes of the ideas He wills to create in ours. The most prominent of these immaterialists was George Berkeley whose overall position is in many respects similar to that of Malebranche though with a dierent emphasis due in part to his place within the Lockean rather than Cartesian tradition. Locke had insisted on a distinction between ideas which are purely in the mind and material things which are the presumed external causes of our perceptual ideas. These ideas represent things as having both primary qualities such as shape size and motion and also secondary qualities such as colour taste and smell but our best theory of the world i.e. Boyles corpuscularianismindicates that only our ideas of pri mary qualities resemble genuine qualities of material things. Berkeley agrees with Locke regarding the essentially mental nature of what is immediately perceived and the main focus of his arguments is to attack the Lockean view that there is something in addition some sup posed material object behind the perceived appleidea. In particular 14 In a sense Gods choice of the laws of motion is arbitrary though Malebranche believed that God would inevitably create the best world consistent with His nature so that His choice of laws would be determined by His wisdom and goodness. He then goes on to attack the basis of the primary secondary quality distinction itself arguing that since our ideas of pri mary qualities are inextricably linked with those of secondary qualities e.g. 5 any such objects would themselves have to be totally inert and hence quite unable to cause any perception of them. Thus Berkeley reaches the conclusion that the only active things in the universe are minds or spirits while everything that we perceive consists of inactive inert ideas. It seems odd that a line of thought inspired by physical science namely the mechanical philosophys emphasis on the inertness of matter should lead to metaphysical positions such as occasionalism and immaterialism that deny physical objects any causal role what ever in the world that we perceive. But Berkeley in particular took pains to develop an account of physical science consistent with his immaterialism and he did this by taking further the instrumentalism hinted at by Newton. On this account the aim of science is simply to discover laws that generate true predictions about the perceived phenomena and it is irrelevant whether the unperceived entities such as forces to which those laws appeal actually have any real existence as long as they provide useful instruments of prediction. If immateri alism is correct then such forcesand even the material objects that Locke and others suppose to be the causes of our perceptionsdo not in fact exist and the apparent intricacy of the physical world is due not to the interaction of complex material mechanisms but instead to Gods direct action. God benevolently ensures that our perceptions occur in the same patterns as they would if they were caused by such Introduction xxviii 15 Berkeley links this with an intense attack on Lockes doctrine of abstraction the process by which we supposedly come to form general ideas. In fact it seems that he mis understood Locke whose notion of abstraction involving partial consideration of some aspects of an idea is rather similar to Berkeleys. Humes own account of general ideas developed from Berkeleys is sketched at E 12.20 endnot. Our sensory ideas of objects are thus signs from God providing us with predictive information rather than perceptions of real material things. But this metaphysical position makes no dierence to the practice or value of science which can proceed regardless and yield benets just as great as if it were genuinely descriptive of an objective material world. The Humean Revolution Against all this background we are now in a position to appreciate the relevance and the revolutionary implications of Humes philoso phy. Put crudely he follows the spirit of Lockes empiricism with respect to both the origin of ideas Enquiry Section II and factual discovery but develops it far more consistently ruthlessly dismiss ing all hints of pure rational insight e.g. Humes rst such sceptical argument Section IV Part i shows that causal laws can be known only by experience but that experi ence gives no real insight into what makes them operate. Hence even the supposed intelligibility of causation by mechanical impact e.g. He then goes on Sections IV Part ii and V to consider how we learn from experi ence which Locke had attributed to the rational perception of prob able evidential connexions. Hume argues against this that all learning from experience and hence all factual reasoning is founded on an instinctive assumption for which we can give no rational basis what ever namely that what we have observed is a reliable guide to the unobserved. Thus our capacity for factual reasoning instead of being a manifestation of angelic rational perception turns out to be dierent only in degree from that of the animals Section IX. Humes next major argument Section VII investigates our very notion of causation concluding that so far from having anything to do with insight into the world it instead involves a projection onto the world of our own inferential behaviour. This might seem to imply dismal prospects for science but Hume turns it to advantage Introduction xxix by insisting on the moral that causationgenuine causationis to be understood in conformity with his analysis and he ends the section by dening cause accordingly. Intelligibility is not to be had but nor is it required and the proper ideal of science is rather to discover and simplify the laws that describe phenomena E 4.12. Thus all causes in science can and should be viewed broadly instrumentally as Newton had done in the case of gravity and Berkeley generalized. This positive message is developed further in Section VIII where Hume follows Hobbes in advocating a deterministic compatibilism. His new under standing of causation signicantly strengthens the case by showing that a lack of intelligibility in the moral world is no obstacle to gen uine causation or determinism concerning human action. Thus moral scienceas exemplied in numerous of Humes essays and other worksis shown to be feasible. He then goes on to attack the rational basis for belief in God Sections X and XI and to advocate a mitigated scepticism which does not aspire to certainty limits our scientic ambitions and restricts them to subjects within the scope of our experience Section XII. From this perspective both Darwinian biology and the develop ment of science since the dawn of the twentieth century can be seen as vindicating Hume. Darwin emphasized our continuity with the animals then relativity theory and quantum physics demonstrated conclusively that the apparent intelligibility of the world that so impressed philosophers from Aristotle to Descartes to Kant and beyond was largely an illusion. As a result the rigorously empiricist and methodologically instrumentalist approach that Hume pioneered has become scientically mainstream and in this respect the Enquiry may today seem relatively innocuous and inoensive. However it still has much to teach even modern scientists who will often stop applying their critical methods outside the laboratory whereas Hume would advise that we take them more seriously into the religious and moral assumptions that drive our lives. To better appreciate the force and implications of all this let us now turn in more detail to the Enquiry itself. Section I The Aims of the Enquiry The rst section of the Enquiry serves as an introduction but starts out as a comparison between two species of moral philosophy i.e. By contrast abstruse philoso phy aims to satisfy the intellect rather than to please the imagination its goal is to discover the actual principles of human nature by systematic rational investigation. Initially Hume gives the appearance of preferring the easy philosophy E 1.36 as more agreeable and down to earth but in fact most of the section is devoted to a defence of abstruse metaphysics spelling out what can reasonably be pleaded in their behalf E 1.7. Humes defence of abstruse metaphysics combines two main themes which might be described as the scientic and the critical. The former highlights the necessity and value of careful precise thinking in establishing general truths about man and the moral world thus the abstruse philosophy can help the easy in much the same way as an anatomist can help a painter as well as fostering the innocent pleasure of discovery. The main objection to this optimistic picture is that such potential discovery of truth is an illusion and it is in response to this objection that the critical theme comes to the fore Here indeed lies the justest and most plausible objection against a consider able part of metaphysics that they are not properly a science but arise either from the fruitless eorts of human vanity which would penetrate into sub jects utterly inaccessible to the understanding or from the craft of popular superstitions which being unable to defend themselves on fair ground raise these intangling brambles to cover and protect their weakness. . . . But is this a sucient reason why philosophers should desist from such researche . . Is it not proper to draw an opposite conclusio . . . . . The only method of freeing learnin . . Accurate and just reason in . . E 1.1112 Introduction xxxi 16 Here moral philosophy is used in its 18thcentury sense rather than in the modern sense of ethics. Note again that unfamiliar or antiquated terms can be consulted in the Glossary below. His critical salvo delivered Hume soon turns back to his scientic theme emphasizing the many positive advantages which result from an accurate scrutiny into the powers and faculties of human nature. It might be suggested that any such supposed science is uncertain and chimerical but Hume responds to this suggestion by insisting that at least some kind of mental geography or delineation of the distinct parts and powers of the mind is clearly defensible and well within our grasp E 1.1314. Moreover our scientic ambitions can legitimately extend deeper than this mere ordering and distinguishing the operations of the mind May we not hope that philosophy if cultivated with car . . Sections II and III The Origin and Association of Ideas Section II of the Enquiry sets out the basic principles of Humes Theory of Ideas most of which is derivative from Lockes Essay concerning Human Understanding. It is perhaps due to the inuence of Lockes attack on innatism cf. above that the origin of ideas is given such a prominent position by Hume but this emphasis is rather mislead ing for it plays an important role only in one later section of the Enquiry Section VII and even here in Section II Humes explicit discussion of the innate ideas controversy merits only a note E 2.9 endnot. Ideas and Impressions Locke like Descartes had used the vague word idea for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks Essay I. Thus according to Locke anyone who sees the blue sky or feels a pain has in his mind an idea of that colour or of that sensation and Introduction xxxii likewise anyone who merely thinks about the sky or contemplates pain also has in his mind corresponding ideas. Hume however considers this broad usage to be inappropriate for it conates together two quite distinct mental operationsnamely the awareness of sensations or feelings and the consideration of thoughtsand only the latter in his opinion can properly be called ideas in the conventional sense. He therefore restricts the scope of idea to refer to thoughts alone coining the new term impression to refer to sensations and feelings and the term perception for the general class of objects of the mind comprising impressions and ideas together so Lockean ideas become Humean perceptions. In general impressions are more forceful and vivacious than ideas though this rule can break down if the mind be disordered by disease or madness E 2.1 a madmans thoughts could be as vivid to him as his sensations in which case he would presumably be unable to tell the dierence.17 Some of Humes discussion suggests a distinction again derived from Locke which he had dened explicitly in the Treatise Simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation. The complex are the contrary of these and may be distin guished into parts. Tho a particular colour taste and smell are qualities all united together in this appletis easy to perceive they are not the same but are at least distinguishable from each other. T 1.1.1.2 Presumably the particular ideas of colour taste etc. Instead he gives two instances of complex ideas namely that of a golden mountain and that of a virtu ous horse each itself composed of two further complex ideas E 2.5. This might suggest that he no longer wishes to commit himself to a view about which ideas if any are absolutely simple though he later hints that ideas of colour seem to be E 2.8. Introduction xxxiii 17 Force and vivacity do not seem to be the best words to capture the distinction between sensory awareness or feelings on the one hand and thoughts on the other because thoughts can sometimes be very vivid e.g. Fortunately very little in the Enquiry depends on exactly how force and vivacity is interpreted. The Copy Principle Hume argues that although our capacity to form ideas may seem completely unbounded in fact all this creative power of the mind amounts to no more than the faculty of compounding transposing augmenting or diminishing the materials aorded us by the senses and experience E 2.5.18 In other words our minds can create new ideas from the components which experience has already given us by combining together our existing ideas in new ways or by shufing the components of our existing ideas but we are quite unable to form any completely new ideas beyond those that have already been given to us by sensation or feeling. Or to express myself in philosophical language all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of our impressions or more lively ones. E 2.5 This is widely known as Humes Copy Principle.19 Hume gives two arguments E 2.6 2.7 for the Copy Principle the rst of which simply claims that all of our existing ideas if examined will in fact turn out to be copied from impressions. Here the example he gives is deliberately chosen to oppose Descartes The idea of God as meaning an innitely intelligent wise and good Being arises from reecting on the operations of our own mind and augmenting without limit those qualities of goodness and wisdom. E 2.6 my italics Obviously the Cartesian could persist in claiming that the idea of God is innate but Humes rival account of the idea is straightforward and plausible and carries force given the weight of his generalization. If all our ideas can be accounted for by the Copy Principle then why should we suppose any mysterious faculty of innate ideas Hume ends Section II by suggesting that the Copy Principle pro vides a potent weapon for eliminating bogus wouldbe ideas that turn Introduction xxxiv 18 Humes famous missing shade of blue E 2.8 highlights another way in which the mind might compoun . . This casts doubt on the claim that all simple ideas must be direct copies of impressions but it does not pose any sort of diculty for his general claim that the materials of our thoughts must ultimately derive from impressions. 9 Without the simplecomplex distinction the principle is hard to express precisely cf. T 1.1.1.7 because a complex idea e.g. The point is that every part of the idea must ultimately be copied from part of some impressioni.e. However in the rest of the Enquiry he uses it less aggressively not to reject ideas but as a tool of analysis a new microscope or species of optics E 7.4 which can make our ideas more clear and precise by discovering the impres sions from which they are derived and of which they are copies.20 As we shall see later his main Application of this microscope comes in Section VII where he uses it to clarify the idea of necessary connex ion but there are also brief hints of its playing a role in Section XII as applied to the ideas of extension E 12.15 space and time E 12.20 endnot. The Association of Ideas The present Section III is merely the rst three paragraphs of what was originally a much longer essay which Hume cut down after the edition by the removal of an extended discussion of the role of the asso ciation of ideas in literature see pp. It is very straightfor ward rst pointing out that our ideas tend to follow each other and to combine with each other in regular patterns. He then suggests that all of this associative behaviour reduces to the operation of three relations or principles of connexion among ideas namely Resemblance Contiguity in time or place and Cause or Eect. The section ends rather tamely with Hume stating that although he can nd no other prin ciples of association besides these three nevertheless he cannot prove that his enumeration is complete. This doesnt seem to be of great con cern to him presumably because nothing of great consequence hangs on it in what follows. Indeed the only signicant role of the association of ideas in the Enquiry is to provide an analogy with the operation of custom. In Part ii of Section V E 5.20 Hume will suggest that custom an instinctive mechanism that underlies all of our factual reasoning operates in a somewhat similar way to the association of ideas. Section IV Humes Fork In Section IV the serious business of the Enquiry begins and Hume presents his most celebrated argument the sceptical argument Introduction xxxv 20 In the Treatise Hume had used the Copy Principle to dismiss a fair number of sup posedly bogus ideas for example material substance T 1.1.6.1 existence T 1.2.6.25 solidity T 1.4.4.1214 mental substance T 1.4.5.34 and the self as something simple and individual Appendix 11. First however there is a vital preliminary. In the rst two paragraphs of Section IV Hume introduces a distinction of enormous importance between relations of ideas and matters of fact a distinction commonly known as Humes Fork. Relations of ideas as the name implies can be known a priori simply by inspecting the nature and internal relations between our ideas and using either immediate intuition e.g. Such truths can therefore be known with complete certainty. Matters of fact by contrast can be known only a posteriori i.e. For this reason there is no internal contra diction in supposing any matter of fact to be otherwiseits falsehood is distinctly conceivableand it follows that no matter of fact can be demonstrated a priori to be true. Thus no matter of fact is intuitively or demonstratively certain. Here are some relatively straightforward examples of the two sides of Humes distinction Relations of Ideas Pythagoras Theorem E 4.1 3 5 30 E 4.1 All bachelors are unmarried a metre contains 100 centimetres Matters of Fact The sun will rise tomorrow E 4.2 The sun will not rise tomorrow E 4.2 Stones fall when released in air Impact causes a billiard ball to move Note that although relations of ideas are a priori and in this sense prior to experience it does not follow that the ideas they involve are innate and in that sense prior to experience. On Humes principles the idea of a bachelor like all other ideas is derived from experience Introduction xxxvi e.g. What makes a truth a priori is that it can be justied without appeal to experience purely by thinking about the ideas involved. Matters of fact by contrast can be known to be true or to be false only by consulting experience. Demonstrative and Factual Reasoning a little later in Section IV Hume draws a related distinction between types of reasoning though he does not spend long explaining it per haps because it was already very familiar from the work of John Locke All reasonings may be divided into two kinds namely demonstrative reasoning or that concerning relations of ideas and moral reasoning or that concerning matter of fact and existence. E 4.18 Demonstrative reasoning is what can be loosely called deductive rea soning21 in which the steps of the argument proceed with absolute certainty based on the logical relations between the ideas concerned e.g. Factual reasoningwhich Hume also calls moral and Locke had called probableis now commonly called inductive inference encompassing all sorts of everyday reasoning in which we draw apparently reasonable but less than logically certain conclusions based on our personal experience testimony our under standing of how people and things behave and so forth.22 11. Sections IV and V The Basis of Factual Reasoning Humes Fork raises the question of how we can know matters of fact that go beyond our immediate experience of sensation and memory E 4.3. It is in response to this enquiry that Hume develops his Introduction xxxvii 21 Taking deductive here in an informal sense rather than the stricter alternative modern notion which limits it to reasoning within a formal system. 2 In this very general sense induction is not connedas the terms Aristotelian origins would suggestto inferences that move from particular observations e.g. The term is not used by Hume himself in either sense. The Sceptical Argument Concerning Induction Suppose I see one loose billiard ball collide with another. I will nat urally expect the second ball to move but how can I knowor even have any ground for reasonable beliefthat it will do so Hume starts by pointing out that any such belief about the unobserved appears to be based on causation I predict that the second ball will move on the basis of a belief that the collision will cause it to do so. Where then do such causal beliefs come from Apparently only from experience because they cannot be known a priori a point on which Hume expands at length E 4.611. But to learn anything from experience we must clearly be able to extrapolate beyond it to draw factual or inductive inferences from what we have observed to what we have not as when we infer that hitherto unobserved billiard balls will behave in the same sorts of ways as those we have experi enced and that the operative causal laws will remain consistent. It follows that all our beliefs about unobserved matters of fact are based on a general principle or supposition of uniformity that the future will resemble or be conformable to the past E 4.19 4.21 and they can be warranted only if this is rationally well founded. The challenge is to identify any such rational foundation if you insist that the inference is made by a chain of reasoning I desire you to produce that reasoning. E 4.16 Hume therefore turns to examine all the potential sources of rational justication for this principle of uniformity. A passage from a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend in Edinburgh written at about the same time as the Enquiry helps to explain his procedure in what follows It is common for Philosophers to distinguish the Kinds of Evidence into intuitive demonstrative sensible and moral le 22 Hume accordingly points out that his uniformity principle cannot be based on rational intuition nor on demonstrative argument from our experience because we can easily conceive of the futures turn ing out dierently E 4.18. Nor can it be founded on anything that we learn by sensory experience since this tells us nothing about objects Introduction xxxviii underlying powerswe learn what powers things have only through practical experience of their eects not by any perception of their nature E 4.16 4.21. All this leaves only moral factual or induc tive argument from experience but even if experience might reli ably tell us what powers objects have had in the past it cannot justify any inference beyond that past experience except by taking for granted the principle that we are trying to establish which would be viciously circular E 4.19. Having thus ruled out intuition demon stration sensation and factual inference the upshot is that none of these conventionally accepted sources of evidence can provide any foundation for the principle of uniformity. Hence Hume concludes it is not reasoning which engages us to suppose the past resembling the future and to expect similar eects from causes which are to appearance similar E 4.23. It seems then that we can give no solid rational basis whatever for our only method of establishing matters of fact beyond the present testimony of our senses or the records of our memory and this result is Humes famous scepticism about induction. Custom and Belief Section V of the Enquiry starts with a paragraph commending philo sophical scepticism strongly contrasting with the typical view of the time which saw the sceptic as a dangerous enemy of religion and morality.23 In opposition to this view Hume goes on to stress that theoretical sceptical doubts even if founded on impeccable philo sophical argument cannot in practice undermine our natural human tendency to draw inferences and form beliefs Though we should conclud . . If the mind be not engaged by argument to make this step it must be induced by some other principle of equal weight and authority E 5.2 Introduction xxxix 23 Humes Letter from a Gentleman quoted in the previous paragraph was written to defend himself against a vitriolic pamphlet which had accused him of Universal Scepticis . . Hume calls this principle of factual inference custom or habit empha sizing its vital role as the great guide of human life without which we should be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses E 5.6. Custom provides an answer to the sceptical doubts that Hume has raised not by addressing them but by ignoring them. It irresistibly leads us to make inferences from observed to unobserved immediately instinc tively and without reection but since these inferences are not founded on reason they are also immune to scepticism about reason E 5.8. All this might seem to make Hume an irrationalist commit ted to denying any criteria for reasonable belief and to accepting the equal legitimacy of any inference that seems natural. But as we shall see later this is very far from being the case. Part ii of Section V discusses the nature of belief though Hume indicates that this discussion is not central to his views and ma . . Whereas Part i seems to be an exercise in what Section I called mental geography identifying custom as one of the central powers and faculties of the human mind E 1.14 Part ii seems to provide a cautious sketch of the kind of deeper study of secret springs and principles E 1.15 that Hume had also anticipated speculating about the underlying basis of customs operation. The main conclusion of this study is simply that custom is somewhat analogous to the association of ideas explained in Section III E 5.20. It therefore provides an illustration of how the science of the human mind can proceed aiming to reduce the prin ciples that govern it to a greater simplicity and to resolve the many particular eects into a few general causes by means of reasonings from analogy experience and observation E 4.12. Hume has already argued that this sort of systematization is the utmost eort of human reason and is the most that science can aspire to given the impos sibility of achieving a priori insight into why things operate as they do. Section V Part ii thus provides a brief illustration of Humes general philosophy of science applied to the study of the human mind. Section VI Of Probability As we saw earlier in Section IV Hume took over from Locke Essay IV. a general distinction between demonstrative and probable rea soning though he generally prefers to call the latter moral reasoning Introduction xl or reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence. On Lockes account no reasoning from past to future can be more than prob able even if it is based on extensive and totally uniform experience as for example when I predict that an unsupported stone when released above the ground will fall. Hume begins Section VI with an important footnote in which he suggests a renement of Lockes terminology coining the term proof for these most strongly grounded experiential inferences and reserving the word probability for infer ences in which past experience is less than uniform. Here he is not of course retracting anything in his previous argument what he now calls proofs are still based on instinct rather than on rational insight but he is pointing out that it seems unnatural to call a conclusion such as that all men will die merely probable since our entirely uni form experience in its favour is psychologically entirely compelling leaving no room for doubt. Section VI aims to provide a brief explanation of probability in Humes new narrower sense showing how the mechanism of causal inference discovered in Section V can be extended to account for our tendency to form beliefs of dierent degrees of conviction in propor tion to mixed evidence. Such an account advances his proposed science of mind by resolving another form of reasoning into an already identied general cause cf. E 4.12 namely custom. Custom typic ally leads our minds to make associative links whose strength is in proportion to the balance of evidence and this can explain both the probability of chances e.g. Hume will later apply this account to the case of miracles in Section X where it turns out that he intends it to be not only explana tory of how we do reason but also normative prescribing how we should reason. His basis for this is not made entirely explicit but the underlying motive seems to be the legitimation of probabilistic rea soning conferring it with authority and respectability by showing it to be derivative from a principle which plays such an essential and irresistible role in our mental life. From now on one of Humes main aims in the Enquiryand arguably his primary aimwill be to spell out the implications of systematically taking custom and custom alone as our touchstone of empirical rationality. Introduction xli 13. Section VII Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion Hume starts Section VII by emphasizing the importance of clarify ing our philosophical ideas focusing particularly on those of power force energy or necessary connexion E 7.3 which are so intimately connected with the vital concept of causation itself the basis of all rea soning from experience as we saw in Section IV. Humes method of clarifying obscure ideas is to make use of the new microscope or species of optics E 7.4 which the Copy Principle of Section II provides by inspecting the impressions from which those ideas are derived. Thus begins the hunt for the impression of necessary connexion.24 PART I a Fruitless Search Hume begins with his favourite example of the two billiard balls. We see one billiard ball striking another see the second one move no doubt hear a sound but what we do not perceive in any way through the senses is the necessity that we assume connects the two events together in that the one event had to be followed by the other. All we see is a sequence of eventswe do not see the causal glue that we assume binds them or the power in the one balls movement by which it communicates motion to the other. Hume proceeds to back up this claim with an important argument several variations on which will be used in the pages to come From the rst appearance of an object we never can conjecture what eect will result from it. But were the power or energy of any cause discoverable by the mind we could foresee the eect even without experience and might at rst pronounce with certainty concerning it by the mere dint of thought and reasoning. E 7.7 This builds on the sceptical argument of Section IV Part i which established that all causal knowledge is a posteriori that nothing about causes and eects can be known in advance of experience. Introduction xlii 24 Hume consistently treats power and necessary connexion as equivalent some times abbreviates the latter to just connexion E 7.28 and also equates these with other terms such as force and energy. This suggests that the key idea whose source he is seeking is not strictly that of necessary connexion but rather the wider notion of connexion in general or a consequential link from one thing to another. This also ts with his view implied by Section VI that the notion of probability is derived from the same source. If we perceived an impression of necessary connexion between a and B he reasons then we could know a priori that a causes B. But we cannot know a priori that a causes B. So it follows that we per ceive no such impression of their necessary connexion. Having ruled out any sensory source for the impression of neces sary connexion Hume moves on to consider the possibility that it might instead be an impression of reection acquired from our aware ness of the minds powers or consciousness of the actions of our will E 7.920. But he denies that this can be so using the same style of argument. He examines the operation of our will rst in moving our body E 7.1015 and then in forming and processing ideas E 7.1620 emphasizing how both types of power can be known only by experience. Hume then takes time ofrom his Search for the impression of necessity to mount a vigorous attack upon Malebranches doctrine of occasionalism explained in 6 above. Malebranche had used argu ments somewhat similar to Humes to maintain that we have no idea of power in objects and he concluded that only God can exert genu ine power. Hume starts his critique by mischievously suggesting that occasionalism has superstitious origins E 7.21. He then dismisses it with two characteristic objections E 7.245 rst that it is too bold and bizarre to be credible cf. E 12.25 and secondly that it is incon sistent since the same reasoning that the occasionalists use to show that power in objects is inconceivable shows equally that power in minds even in a divine mind is also inconceivable. Although Humes hunt for the elusive impression of necessary connexion has so far been in vain his arguments of Section VII Part i have succeeded in other ways. He has attacked the foundation of Cartesian science based as it is on the ideal of clear and distinct perception of natures workings by denying outright that any causal interactions at alleven those of Godare in any way intelligible. We cannot understand how billiard balls communicate motion by impulse nor how the mind has command over the body nor even how any mind whether human or divine has command over itself. And the fact that we cannot understand these operations proves that we cannot perceive the necessity which supposedly governs them. All are equally unintelligible equally opaque to clear and distinct perception. Introduction xliii PART II Cause Successfully Dened The rst paragraph of Part ii provides a useful summary of Part i pointing towards the sceptical conclusion that the idea of necessary connexion is entirely bogus and the term meaningless. But Hume then suggests an alternative which proves to be more fruitful. Perhaps the impression of necessary connexion is not one that we perceive in particular instances of causal interactions whether these be external or internal physical or mental but is instead an impression that arises from repetition when it leads us through the operation of custom to make causal inferences This connexion therefore which we feel in the mind this customary transition of the imagination from one object to its usual attendant is the sentiment or impression from which we form the idea of power or necessary connexion. E 7.28 Thus the idea of necessary connexion is derived from our own aware ness of making causal inferences. Having seen a and B constantly con joined in the past when we see an a we just nd ourselves expecting a B and we are aware of having made this transition of thought or inference. It is the inference itself that then gives content to our idea of connexion that inference of the understanding which is the only connexion that we can have any comprehension of E 8.25. When we say that a is the cause of B we naturally think of this causal linkthis supposed necessary connexionas the basis of our infer ence from a to B. But the central core of Humes message is that this is the wrong way round it is our tendency to infer B from a that gives content to the causal claim and so as he put it in the Treatise the necessary connexion depends on the inference instead of the infer ences depending on the necessary connexion T 1.3.6.3. The idea of necessary connexion has now been vindicated as a bona de idea but shown to be copied from something internal which Humein line with his Copy Principlecalls an impression but which would perhaps be more accurately described as a reexive awareness of our own inferential behaviour. It seems to follow that we have no real idea of any sort of power or necessity that might be sup posed to reside in objects leading Hume to his famousindeed notor ioussubjectivist conclusion about necessity and hence causation When we say therefore that one object is connected with another we mean only that they have acquired a connexion in our thought E 7.28 Introduction xliv The necessity of any action whether of matter or of mind is not properly speaking a quality in the agent but in any thinking or intelligent being who may consider the action. E 8.22 endnote Some recent interpreters have cast doubt on the extent to which pas sages such as these reect a genuine subjectivism on Humes part.25 But in terms of its inuence on epistemology metaphysics and the philosophy of science this antirealism about causation along with his inductive scepticism constitutes his most prominent legacy. Having nally tracked down the impression of necessary connexion Hume sets about clarifying the notion of cause of which necessary connexion is the central component. He gives two denitions of cause also adding a gloss on the rst of them an object followed by another26 and where all the objects similar to the rst are followed by objects similar to the second. Or in other words where if the rst object had not been the second never had existed.27 an object followed by another and whose appearance always conveys the thought to that other. E 7.29 Since Hume has already argued that the idea of necessity cannot lit erally be dened in the sense of a conceptual analysis or dictionary denition i.e. They seem to be intended to capture the circumstances under which we come to ascribe causal connexion with the rst denition focusing on the kind of observation that leads someone to believe in such a connexion namely the observation of what appears to that person to be a constant conjunction while the second denition focuses instead on what the student of human Introduction xlv 25 The main contributions to this ongoing debate are most easily accessible in Rupert Read and Kenneth A. Richman eds. The New Hume Debate Routledge 2nd edn. 6 In the Treatise T 1.3.14.31 Hume had insisted that a cause must be contiguous with its eect as well as temporally prior but he dropped this condition from the Enquiry cf. 7 This gloss cannot possibly be equivalent to 1 even if it is interpreted as a straight forward past tense conditional meaning where if the rst object was not the second was not either. Denition 1 states that the rst object has never appeared without the second which implies that if the second object was not the rst was not either. So Humes gloss is puzzling seeming to get things the wrong way round. Hume acknow ledges that his denitions fall short of what might be wished for neither of them identies anything about the specic cause in itself that con nects it with its eect for it is only in virtue of the pattern of events the conjunction in other instances or the consequent tendency to draw inferencesthat the causal link can be ascribed. We are naturally inclined to want more to try to grasp that circumstance in the cause which gives it a connexion with its eect. But on Humes subject ivist principles even this wish is incoherent We have no idea of this connexion nor even any distinct notion what it is we desire to know when we endeavour at a conception of it E 7.29. So Humes two denitions capture everything that we can coherently mean in ascrib ing causal connexions. Though we hanker after a deeper and more substantial conception of causation some notion of the supposed causal glue that binds events together we cannot achieve this nor even any coherent understanding of what it is that we thus seek This does not however undermine the notion of cause rather it shows that the notion is to be ascribed purely on the basis of Humes two denitions cf. Section VIII Of Liberty and Necessity In Section VIII Hume pursues a reconciling project E 8.23 pre senting a compatibilist solution to the ancient problem of free will and determinism. As briey discussed in 4 above he follows Hobbes in claiming that the doctrine of necessityi.e. Hobbes had based his compatibilism on a denition of freedom as being able to do what one wills without hindrance and Humes denition of liberty is in the same spirit By liberty then we can only mean a power of acting or not acting according to the determinations of the will that is if we chuse to remain at rest we may if we chuse to move we also may. E 8.23 Liberty so dened is obviously compatible with determinism if our actions follow our will then we do have such liberty even if our will Introduction xlvi itself is entirely causally determined. Hobbes had maintained that our will is indeed thus determined and Hume agrees but his distinc tive contribution to the debate is to provide a new argument for this claim appealing to the understanding of necessity reached in Section VII Our ide . . Beyond the constant conjunction of similar objects and the consequent inference from one to the other we have no notion of any necessity or connexion. E 8.5 Most of Part i of Section VIII is devoted to making the case that human actions manifest such uniformity that they are generally recognized as doing so and that people standardly perform inductive inferences accordingly. Hence all mankin . . Hume attributes this mismatch to mens propensity to believe that they penetrate farther into the powers of nature and perceive something like a necessary connexion between the cause and the eect. Such penetration is of course an illusion as shown in Sections IV and VII and it is this recognition that provides the key to properly understanding the necessity of human actions. In learning that the necessity of physical operations amounts to no more than constant conjunction and con sequent inference we come to see that human actions too are subject to the same necessity. While making this case Hume in passing develops his view of inductive science as sketched earlier in Section IV E 4.12. We should look for causal relations that are entirely constant E 8.13 seeking for deeper laws that underlie supercial irregularities. And we should do this not only in natural philosophy but in the human realm also with equal expectation of success. In Part ii of Section VIII Hume turns to address the consequences of his determinist worldview for morality and religion. He starts E 8.27 by reemphasizing that his most distinctive contribution is to undermine the supposed metaphysical necessity of the physical world rather than to propose any novel understanding of human action. He then goes on to argue for another distinctive claim E 8.2830 that Introduction xlvii viewing human behaviour as causally determined so far from being contrary to morality is actually essential to it since blame and pun ishment are appropriate only where actions are caused by the agents durable character and disposition. This argument however even if accepted does little to resolve the widely felt tension between determinism and moral responsibility if everything that I do was preordained before I was even born then how can I be genuinely responsible It might now seem that the notion of moral responsibil ity has turned out to be incoherent both requiring and yet being incompatible with determinism. Hume sketches his solution to this conundrum when discussing the religious implications of his views E 8.345 a solution based on his moral theory which is sentimen talist i.e. Here Hume does little more than drop this hint the full development of his sentimentalist moral theory comes in the companion work his Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals. Section IX Of the Reason of Animals In the wake of the Darwinian revolution it is no surprise that there should be similarities between animal and human thinking but in the eighteenth century the suggestion was potentially quite shocking.28 Human reason was commonly thought to be quasidivine or angelic rather than beastlike a faculty expressing the essence of our unique immaterial soul capable of providing transparent insight into the nature of things and operating quite independently of brute animal Introduction xlviii 28 Darwins notebooks of 9 record that he read Humes section on the reason of animals just at the time that he was developing his theory of evolution. Perhaps for this reason Humes discussion is quite short and steers clear of the dangerous implications made explicit in his essay Of the Immortality of the Soul included in this volume as Appendix II. The main point Hume emphasizes here is a corollary of his induc tive approach to science since all our factual reasonings are founded on an assumption of uniformity or resemblance their strength can be expected to depend on the degree of resemblance involved. Though Hume illustrates this point by the analogy between humans and animalsappealing to the instinctive nature of animal reasoning to corroborate his claim from Sections IV and V that human reason ing is instinctive alsohis methodological message is more general. This is that reasoning from analogy is a natural extension of infer ence based on custom just as probabilistic reasoning was shown to be in Section VI. Section X Of Miracles Though mainly concerned with miracles Section X has a far wider signicance because here we see how Humes theory of induction based on custom has a critical edge helping us to weigh up conicting evidence appropriately particularly in the case of evidence from tes timony. Hume starts E 10.34 by recalling his account of probability from Section VI making its normative implications very explicit a wise man therefore proportions his belief to the evidence. . . . All prob ability then supposes an opposition of experiments and observations where the one side is found to overbalance the other and to produce a degree of evidence proportioned to the superiority. E 10.4 He goes on to argue that this general principle should be applied equally in the case of testimony hence the credit that we give to reports of witnesses should be proportioned to their experienced reliability. However experience indicates that the reliability of witnesses varies depending on a number of factors such as the opposition of contrary testimon . . These are all factors that we naturallyand rightlytake into account when assessing the overall credibility of testimony which will depend in each case on the balance between the positive and negative factors involved. Introduction xlix Humes main point in Part i of Section X is that there is another factor to put into this balancing operation which does not depend on the nature of the witnesses but rather on the nature of the reported event. If this supposed event is quite contrary to our uniform experi ence or even apparently miraculous then that experience itself pro vides strong inductive evidence against the events occurrence.29 Hence in assessing the overall credibility of the testimony we must balance whatever experience we might have in favour of the reliabil ity of the witnesses against this contrary evidence The plain consequence is and it is a general maxim worthy of our atten tion That no testimony is sucient to establish a miracle unless the testi mony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish And even in that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments and the superior only gives us an assur ance suitable to that degree of force which remains after deducting the inferior. E 10.13 Hume can here be seen as anticipating a result that is now very famil iar to theoreticians but all too often ignored more widely that when assessing the evidence for some event it is important to take into account the background probability of the event itself.30 Humes general maxim sets a demanding requirement for testi mony to establish a miracle. Then in Part ii he gives four arguments to suggest that this requirement is in practice never likely to be satised especially in the case of miracles associated with a religion. First no miracle in history has in fact been suciently well attested by suciently many reliable witnesses E 10.15. Secondly the pleasant passion of surprise and wonder makes miracle stories particularly Introduction l 29 As we saw above in Section VI Hume coins the term proof for this strongest type of inductive argument based on totally uniform experience. However such proofs are not necessarily irresistible and his discussion of miracles makes very clear that they can dier in strength and potentially conict see also his letter at p. 0 Suppose for example that I am worried about a genetic disease that aficts one in a million people and take a test for it which has a 99.9 chance of giving the correct result i.e. Most people would naturally take a positive result as showing that I very probably have the disease. However the one in a million background probability outweighs the one in a thousand chance of the tests getting it wrong leaving an overall probability that I have the disease based on this evidence of only 1 in 1002. Thus a false test is far more likely than the disease itself. As the history of forged miracles amply demonstrates a religious person may lie for the sake of pro moting so holy a cause or out of vanity or he may be gullible or swayed by eloquence since many renounce their reason in questions of religion. Thirdly miracle stories almost all abound amongst igno rant and barbarous nations suggesting that they are indeed products of imagination rather than provable fact E 10.203. Finally if a miracle is supposed to establish the religion or sect to which it is attributed and since the various religions are incompatible it follows that the evidence for any miracle will be opposed by the evidence in favour of the far greater number of miracles reported in other reli gions. Hume illustrates this point E 10.257 with some apparently wellevidenced miracles that he is condent his readers will reject thus suggesting that the dismissive attitude they naturally feel towards miracles associated with the Roman emperor Vespasian for example should equally be extended to the Christian miracles they are inclined to accept. Putting all these points together Upon the whol . . Moreover because of the distinctive ten dency of religions to propagate bogus miracle stories and to generate fanciful testimony for them no human testimony can have such force as to prove a miracle and make it a just foundation for any system of religion E 10.35. Outside a religious context there could conceivably be sucient evidence for some kinds of miracles though perhaps not for a resurrectionE 10.37 but if a miracle be ascribed to any new system of religio . . Proof here does not imply that reli gious miracles are logically impossible cf. 9 above it is simply that our extensive experience of the hopeless unreliability of reli giously inspired miracle stories counts decisively against their credi bility. An omnipotent deity could of course bring about whatever the stories report. But even if God exists experience remains our only guide to His ways of working and hence in assessing the stories we are still reduced to comparing the reliability of testimony with the reliability of the apparent laws of nature E 10.38. Even for the theist custom and induction provide the only route to factual discovery. Introduction li 17. Section XI Of a Particular Providence and of a Future State Most of the argument of Section XI is put in the mouth of a friend who loves sceptical paradoxes and placed in a classical context to enable Hume to distance himself from his controversial critique of the Design Argument for a Christian God which when he wrote was the most respected weapon in the theists arsenal cf. Humes main point against that argument is that it can never prove the existence of a being with more impressive qualities e.g. So we can never argue rst from the world to God and then back from the nature of that inferred God to draw new conclusions about the worldfor example that there is an afterlife in which the good will be rewarded and the evil punished. Just as in Section X therefore Hume is working out the implications of basing our knowledge of the world on induction. Experimental theists claim to provide a solid rational foundation for their belief in God based not on speculative metaphysics nor on special divine revelation but on the relatively downtoearth methods of inductive science reasonably drawing inferences from eects to causes.31 Hume counters that they have aided the ascent of reason by the wings of imagination otherwise they could not thus change their manner of inference and argue from causes to eects presuming that a more perfect production than the present world would be more suitable to such perfect beings as the gods and forgetting that they have no reason to ascribe to these celestial beings any perfection or any attribute but what can be found in the present world. E 11.16 Again Hume attacks a theistic argument and in doing so usesand highlightsprinciples that are of far broader Application. As well as this principle of proportionality that we should proportion hypothe sized causes to their observed eects Section XI also reemphasizes the principle of analogy from Section IX that an inductive argu ments strength varies with the degree of similarity between the objects involved so that any inference from human purposes to those Introduction lii 31 In the excerpt from Humes Dialogues see Appendix III Cleanthes expresses this preference very clearly. It is instructive to read Section XI of the Enquiry alongside both the Dialogues and the essay Of the Immortality of the Soul see Appendix II. Hume also hints at two other general principles that it is problematic to draw conclusions about any supposed cause that is known only through a single mani festation E 11.256 andeven more soany supposed cause of a unique type E 11.30. Section XII Of the Academical or Sceptical Philosophy In Section XII Hume discusses a wide array of sceptical arguments clarifying his own nely balanced attitude to them. While acknowl edging many of them to be irrefutable he nevertheless resists on practical rather than purely theoretical grounds being forced by them into excessive scepticism. This approach is typied by his short treatment of antecedent scepticism at E 12.34 where he contrasts the futile and selfdefeating extremes of Cartesian doubt with a more moderate caution and modesty that he fully endorses.32 He then moves on to discuss several varieties of consequent scepticism scepticism arising from specic considerations rather than generalized a priori distrust of our facultiesand these occupy most of Part i and all of Part ii. Turning rst to our sensory belief in the external world Hume attributes this to a blind and powerful instinct of nature E 12.8 which however leads us to identify physical objects with the very images that appear to our minds. This identication raises obvious problems because the perceptions of the mind are so eeting E 12.9 hence to maintain our instinctive belief in a durable external world modern philosophers such as Locke adopt the theory of representative realism postulating physical objects that are distinct from and causes of those perceptions. Drawing on his theory of causation Hume now emphasizes the impossibility of establishing any such theory. If we are only ever directly acquainted with our perceptions and never with their supposed causes then no connexion between the twono constant conjunction cf. E 7.28 8.5can ever be observed. Even worse an argument derived from Berkeley E 12.15 suggests that the Lockean theory is not only groundless but vacuous or incoherent. Introduction liii 32 Descartes used extreme scepticism as a tool for sweeping away traditional views and claimed to establish his own rst principles as clearly and distinctly perceived sup posedly immune even to the most radical doubt. For Lockes understanding of perception depends on a distinction between primary and secondary qualities where the former e.g. But Hume agrees with Berkeley that our ideas of primary qualities are entirely dependent on those of secondary qualities for example we acquire an idea of an extended area by seeing it dierently coloured from its surroundings. Hence if we try to imagine an external object as independent of our percep tions distinct from all minddependent qualities then we are forced to bereave matter of all its intelligible qualities both primary and secondary and we are left only with a certain unknown inexplic able something as the cause of our perceptions a notion so imperfect that no sceptic will think it worth while to contend against it E 12.16. One important upshot of this discussion is that any attempt to pene trate the essence of physical objectsso popular amongst theological metaphysicians intent on proving matters inertness cf. above is doomed to failure. Part ii of Section XII turns to scepticism about our reasoning facul ties starting with some of the notorious paradoxes of innite divisi bility. Hume describes and seems to endorse them though in a note E 12.20 endnote he suggests that it may be possible to avoid these absurdities and contradictions by appeal to a nonabstractionist theory of general ideas as developed more fully in Treatise 1.1.7. He then moves on to scepticism about factual reasoning rst dismissing on practical groundsan excessive popular variant which takes our inconsistent judgements to undermine all inductive reasoning The great subverter of Pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of scepticism is action and employment and the occupations of common life. These prin ciples may ourish and triumph in the schools where it is indeed dicult if not impossible to refute them. But as soon as they leave the shade and by the presence of the real objects which actuate our passions and sentiments are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature they vanish like smoke E 12.21 More substantial is a philosophical variant of scepticism about induction Humes own argument from Section IV in summary form E 12.22. This too can be criticized as excessive if it goes to the Pyrrhonian extreme of attempting to undermine all belief but fortunately for our survival human nature is too strong to make such avoidance of belief Introduction liv a genuine possibility. We simply cannot help forming beliefs through custom as Hume has already explained in Section V even though we have no rational basis for the assumption of uniformity on which such beliefs are founded. This appeal to the unavoidability of belief can be used to dismiss total scepticismi.e. Indeed Hume suggests that a sceptical appreciation of the weakness of our faculties combined with a recog nition of the practical inevitability of belief can lead us to a form of undogmatic mitigated scepticism in which our doubts and beliefs are cautiously assessed and corrected by common sense and reection. It is also natural to combine this caution with a modest restriction of our enquiries to such subjects as are best adapted to the narrow capacity of human understanding E 12.25 given that even in common life we cannot provide any solid reason for supposing our faculties to be reliable. Empirical science can comfortably be accommodated by this approach in so far as it is simply a more systematic Application of everyday inductive reasoning that is the reections of common life methodized and corrected. Moreover the earlier sections of the Enquiry have already shown what such methodizing and correction involves and how custom can ground such procedures as the explanation of phenomena by relatively simple and potentially quantiable laws E 4.1213 7.25 endnote 7.29 endnote the calculation of probabilities by past frequencies E 6.24 10.37 the systematic Search for hidden causes E 8.1315 the use of analogy E 9.1 11.246 proportionate inference E 11.1216 and so on. The overall shape of this defence of inductive science is most con cisely sketched by Philo in Humes posthumous Dialogues concerning Natural Religion. Scepticism may be theoretically irrefutable but even the sceptic must ac . . Reasonings of common life are thus vindicated but we may well be driven further by curiosity in which case our scientic speculations can also share in this vindi cation if they proceed in the same spirit as a systematic extension of everyday inductive thinking consider . . To philosophise on such subjects is nothing essentially dierent from reasoning on common life and we may only expect greater stability if not greater truth from our philosophy on account of its exacter and more scrupulous method of proceeding. 545 below Humes scepticism thus leaves room for a scientic approach founded on modest inductive systematization but the sceptical thrust remains in what is excluded. All knowledge of matter of fact beyond what we immediately perceive and remember depends on causation E 4.4 while causal lawswhether concerning the operations of matter E 4.613 7.68 or mind E 7.920are discoverable only by experience. If we reason priori any thing may appear able to pro duce any thing E 12.29. Hence rational insight into the nature of things is a hopeless fantasy and it is impossible a priori to prove the existence of God or indeed of anything else E 12.13 12.289. Thus a priori demonstration is limited to the abstract realm of ideas but only in mathematics are our ideas suciently precise to make demonstrative argument genuinely fruitful E 12.27. The upshot of all this is to limit the worthwhile elds of investigation to mathemat ics which is a priori but concerns only relations of ideas and induc tive empirical science which concerns matters of fact but is uncertain and empirical. Any work that purports to transcend these limits by establishing matters of fact with demonstrative certaintywhat Immanuel Kant would later call synthetic a priori knowledgecan therefore be roundly condemned as Hume expresses in his famous concluding paragraph When we run over libraries persuaded of these principles what havoc must we make If we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics for instance let us ask Does it contain any abstract reasoning containing quantity or number No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence No. Commit it then to the ames for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. E 12.34 Introduction lvi NOTE ON THE TEXT What is now known as Humes rst Enquiry was originally published in by Andrew Millar of the Strand London under the Title Philosophical Essays concerning Human Understanding. A second edi tion appeared in and this was reprinted in and the latter in the form of volume ii of Humes fourvolume Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects. This arrangement was retained in the third edition of at which point volume ii was the only one of the four to be reissued. The next edition of the Essays and Treatises in combined the constituent works into a single volume and here Hume permanently changed the Title of his Philosophical Essays to An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding. In the fourvolume and editions of the Essays and Treatises the Enquiry appeared in volume iii with a Dissertation on the Passions. In the two volume editions of and it appeared at the beginning of volume ii followed in order by a Dissertation on the Passions An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals and The Natural History of Religion. The Final and Editions Hume took great pains over correcting his texts and there is no doubt that the last two editions of the Enquiry that he prepared of and are the most authoritative. The latter incorporates corrections made shortly before his death in most notably a substantial deletion from Section III wellmotivated in my view since the deleted material distracts from rather than contributing to the central thrust of the work. What was for many years the stan dard modern edition by SelbyBigge and later Nidditch Clarendon Press 3rd edn. Tom Beauchamps recent Clarendon critical edition is vastly superior but he instead takes the edition as his copytext on the basis that this was the last edition to be seen through the press with Humes supervision and he accordingly includes the deleted Section III material. While not disputing Beauchamps general editorial principles and practice which included properly consulting the text for evidence of late authorial changes p. For this reason the text here very carefully follows the edition with minimal editorial intervention except as explained below. My aim in other words has been to create not a critical edition but an entirely accurate edition of which no other currently exists except in facsimile and very expensive form. Hence in this socalled diplo matic edition even the inconsistencies in Humes original for example in spellings or capitalization e.g. Likewise the wording of the running headers has been retained though here the font stylewhich in every case followed that of the chapter headinghas been modernized and the terminating full stops removed. The full stops which origi nally followed all the headings within the text have also been removed. Only in three cases have substantive changes been made where typo graphical corrections were clearly required and could be identied by reference to other editions these involve the insertion of within 3.3 n. within endnote and the substitution of reasoning for reasonings in the rst line of endnot. My text was prepared from the copy of the edition in the Brotherton Library at the University of Leeds and checked also against the facsimile edition published by Thoemmes Press i. Treatment of Humes Notes In Humes editions both footnotes and endnotes are indicated by symbols rather than numbers typically for the rst on each page then and as necessary e.g. Since Humes original pagination is almost never referenced by the second ary literature and these symbols have no other signicance I have replaced them by numbers so as to correspond with the footnote Note on the Text lviii numbering in Beauchamps critical edition. This causes one small complication Beauchamps note 5 from the edition is absent from the text followed here and hence appears only in the textual variant of Section III p. Apart from the change of symbolic indicators Humes original foot notes remain here in exactly their original form including the place ment of the indicators. The endnote references have however been slightly changed to ease navigation. Thus for example the bottom line of page 174 in Humes edition was See NOT. In this edition these two lines on pages 120 and 131 respectively have been changed to 35 See endnote p. Endnote to 12.29 p. thus making crossreferring easier and incorporating the Beauchamp note numbers as superscripts in this case note 35 the last of the book. In editions prior to all notes appeared as footnotes and Beauchamps edition follows the same practice unfortunately with out indicating what form each note took in the subsequent editions. That Hume took an interest in such matters is clear from his letters notably to his printer William Strahan on 8 April I am very much taken with Mr Gibbons Roman History which came from your pres . . I intended to have given him my Advice with regard to the manner of printing i . . One i . . All these Authorities ought only to be printed at the Margin on the Bottom of the Page. I desire that a Copy of my new Edition i.e. HL ii. 13 In another letter to Strahan of 8 June Hume reports the seriousness of his illness and makes some last requests concerning the printing of My Own Life in his forthcoming edition and the future publi cation of the Dialogues concerning Natural Religion. Here again he expresses enthusiasm for the quality of what would become the Note on the Text lix edition of the Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects including the rst Enquiry and the edition of the History of England I am glad to nd that you have been able to set about this New Edition in earnest. I have made it extremely correct at least I believe that if I were to live twenty Years longer I shoud never be able to give it any further Improvements. HL ii. 22 Hence the policy followed here of carefully reproducing that edition including its distinction between footnotes and endnotes with footnotes being used for references to Authorities and other relatively short comments and endnotes generally containing the longer material. Whether the distinction has any deeper signicance is now open for the reader to judge but since the footnotes at E 5.17 and E 7.8 are both longer than one or more of the endnotes this at least suggests that length was not Humes only criterion. References to Other Editions The vast majority of the existing secondary literature on Hume refers to the Enquiry using page numbers from the SelbyBigge and Nidditch editions Enquiries concerning Human Understanding and concerning the Principles of Morals Clarendon Press an. Hence page references to the edition have been indicated through out this text using numbers in the outer margin. Beauchamps recent Clarendon edition has moved to a dierent method of reference using section and paragraph numbers which seems likely to become stand ard and is used here in the editorial material. Accordingly paragraph numbers are also provided throughout the text preceding every paragraph except the rst of each section. Use of both methods of reference is already standard amongst Hume scholars and required by the Hume Societys journal Hume Studies. Hence this edition has been designed to accommodate both. I should like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the debt that I and other Hume scholars owe to Tom Beauchamp for the painstak ing work that he put into his excellent critical edition of the Enquiry.

Chronology lxv This page intentionally left blank AN ENQUIRY CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING ADVERTISEMENT M ost of the principles and reasonings contained in this volume were published in a work in three volumes called a Treatise of Human Nature a work which the Author had projected before he left College and which he wrote and published not long after. But not finding it successful he was sensible of his error in going to the press too early and he cast the whole anew in the following pieces where some negligences in his former reasoning and more in the expression are he hopes corrected. Yet several writers who have honoured the Authors Philosophy with answers have taken care to direct all their batteries against that juvenile work which the Author never acknow ledged and have affected to triumph in any advantages which they imagined they had obtained over it a practice very contrary to all rules of candour and fairdealing and a strong instance of those polemical artifices which a bigotted zeal thinks itself authorised to employ. Henceforth the Author desires that the following Pieces may alone be regarded as containing his philosophical sentiments and principles. SECTION I Of the Different Species of Philosophy M oral philosophy or the science of human nature may be treated after two dierent manners each of which has its peculiar merit and may contribute to the entertainment instruction and reformation of mankind. The one considers man chiey as born for action and as inuenced in his measures by taste and sentiment pursuing one object and avoiding another according to the value which these objects seem to possess and according to the light in which they present themselves. As virtue of all objects is allowed to be the most valuable this species of philosophers paint her in the most amiable colours borrowing all helps from poetry and eloquence and treating their subject in an easy and obvious manner and such as is best tted to please the imagination and engage the aections. They select the most striking observations and instances from common life place opposite characters in a proper contrast and alluring us into the paths of virtue by the views of glory and happiness direct our steps in these paths by the soundest precepts and most illustrious examples. They make us feel the dierence between vice and virtue they excite and regulate our sentiments and so they can but bend our hearts to the love of probity and true honour they think that they have fully attained the end of all their labours. The other species of philosophers consider man in the light of a reasonable rather than an active being and endeavour to form his understanding more than cultivate his manners. They regard human nature as a subject of speculation and with a narrow scrutiny examine it in order to nd those principles which regulate our understanding excite our sentiments and make us approve or blame any particular object action or behaviour. They think it a reproach to all literature that philosophy should not yet have xed beyond controversy the foundation of morals reasoning and criticism and should for ever talk of truth and falsehood vice and virtue beauty and deformity without being able to determine the source of these distinctions. While they attempt this arduous task they are deterred by no diculties but proceeding from particular instances to general 5 6 principles they still push on their enquiries to principles more gen eral and rest not satised till they arrive at those original principles by which in every science all human curiosity must be bounded. Though their speculations seem abstract and even unintelligible to common readers they aim at the approbation of the learned and the wise and think themselves suciently compensated for the labour of their whole lives if they can discover some hidden truths which may contribute to the instruction of posterity. It is certain that the easy and obvious philosophy will always with the generality of mankind have the preference above the accurate and abstruse and by many will be recommended not only as more agreeable but more useful than the other. It enters more into common life moulds the heart and aections and by touching those principles which actuate men reforms their conduct and brings them nearer to that model of perfection which it describes. On the contrary the abstruse philosophy being founded on a turn of mind which cannot enter into business and action vanishes when the philosopher leaves the shade and comes into open day nor can its principles easily retain any inuence over our conduct and behaviour. The feelings of our heart the agitation of our passions the vehemence of our aections dissipate all its conclusions and reduce the profound philosopher to a mere plebeian. This also must be confessed that the most durable as well as justest fame has been acquired by the easy philosophy and that abstract reasoners seem hitherto to have enjoyed only a momentary reputation from the caprice or ignorance of their own age but have not been able to support their renown with more equitable posterity. It is easy for a profound philosopher to commit a mistake in his sub tile reasonings and one mistake is the necessary parent of another while he pushes on his consequences and is not deterred from embrac ing any conclusion by its unusual appearance or its contradiction to popular opinion. But a philosopher who purposes only to represent the common sense of mankind in more beautiful and more engaging colours if by accident he falls into error goes no farther but renew ing his appeal to common sense and the natural sentiments of the mind returns into the right path and secures himself from any dan gerous illusions. The fame of Cicero ourishes at present but that of Aristotle is utterly decayed. La Bruyere passes the seas and still maintains his reputation But the glory of Malebranche Section I 4 7 is conned to his own nation and to his own age. And Addison perhaps will be read with pleasure when Locke shall be entirely forgotten. The mere philosopher is a character which is commonly but little acceptable in the world as being supposed to contribute nothing either to the advantage or pleasure of society while he lives remote from communication with mankind and is wrapped up in principles and notions equally remote from their comprehension. On the other hand the mere ignorant is still more despised nor is any thing deemed a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences ourish than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble enter tainments. The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes retaining an equal ability and taste for books company and business preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters and in business that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy. In order to diuse and cultivate so accomplished a character nothing can be more useful than compositions of the easy style and manner which draw not too much from life require no deep Application or retreat to be comprehended and send back the student among mankind full of noble sentiments and wise precepts applicable to every exigence of human life. By means of such compositions virtue becomes amiable science agreeable company instructive and retirement entertaining. Man is a reasonable being and as such receives from science his proper food and nourishment But so narrow are the bounds of human understanding that little satisfaction can be hoped for in this particular either from the extent or security of his acquisitions. Man is a sociable no less than a reasonable being But neither can he always enjoy company agreeable and amusing or preserve the proper relish for them. Man is also an active being and from that disposition as well as from the various necessities of human life must submit to business and occupation But the mind requires some relaxation and cannot always support its bent to care and industry. It seems then that nature has pointed out a mixed kind of life as most suitable to human race and secretly admonished them to allow none of these biasses to draw too much so as to incapacitate them for other occupations and entertainments. Indulge your passion for science says she but let your science be human and such as may have a direct reference to action and society. Abstruse thought and profound researches I prohibit and Of the Different Species of Philosophy 5 8 9 will severely punish by the pensive melancholy which they introduce by the endless uncertainty in which they involve you and by the cold reception which your pretended discoveries shall meet with when communicated. Be a philosopher but amidst all your philosophy be still a man. Were the generality of mankind contented to prefer the easy philosophy to the abstract and profound without throwing any blame or contempt on the latter it might not be improper perhaps to comply with this general opinion and allow every man to enjoy without oppo sition his own taste and sentiment. But as the matter is often carried farther even to the absolute rejecting of all profound reasonings or what is commonly called metaphysics we shall now proceed to consider what can reasonably be pleaded in their behalf. We may begin with observing that one considerable advantage which results from the accurate and abstract philosophy is its sub serviency to the easy and humane which without the former can never attain a sucient degree of exactness in its sentiments precepts or reasonings. All polite letters are nothing but pictures of human life in various attitudes and situations and inspire us with dierent senti ments of praise or blame admiration or ridicule according to the qualities of the object which they set before us. An artist must be better qualied to succeed in this undertaking who besides a delicate taste and a quick apprehension possesses an accurate knowledge of the internal fabric the operations of the understanding the workings of the passions and the various species of sentiment which discriminate vice and virtue. How painful soever this inward Search or enquiry may appear it becomes in some measure requisite to those who would describe with success the obvious and outward appearances of life and manners. The anatomist presents to the eye the most hideous and dis agreeable objects but his science is useful to the painter in delineating even a Venus or an Helen. While the latter employs all the richest colours of his art and gives his gures the most graceful and engaging airs he must still carry his attention to the inward structure of the human body the position of the muscles the fabric of the bones and the use and gure of every part or organ. Accuracy is in every case advantageous to beauty and just reasoning to delicate sentiment. In vain would we exalt the one by depreciating the other. Besides we may observe in every art or profession even those which most concern life or action that a spirit of accuracy however Section I 6 10 acquired carries all of them nearer their perfection and renders them more subservient to the interests of society. And though a philoso pher may live remote from business the genius of philosophy if care fully cultivated by several must gradually diuse itself throughout the whole society and bestow a similar correctness on every art and call ing. The politician will acquire greater foresight and subtility in the subdividing and balancing of power the lawyer more method and ner principles in his reasonings and the general more regularity in his discipline and more caution in his plans and operations. The stability of modern governments above the ancient and the accuracy of modern philosophy have improved and probably will still improve by similar gradations. Were there no advantage to be reaped from these studies beyond the gratication of an innocent curiosity yet ought not even this to be despised as being one accession to those few safe and harmless pleasures which are bestowed on human race. The sweet est and most inoensive path of life leads through the avenues of sci ence and learning and whoever can either remove any obstructions in this way or open up any new prospect ought so far to be esteemed a benefactor to mankind. And though these researches may appear painful and fatiguing it is with some minds as with some bodies which being endowed with vigorous and orid health require severe exercise and reap a pleasure from what to the generality of mankind may seem burdensome and laborious. Obscurity indeed is painful to the mind as well as to the eye but to bring light from obscurity by whatever labour must needs be delightful and rejoicing. But this obscurity in the profound and abstract philosophy is objected to not only as painful and fatiguing but as the inevitable source of uncertainty and error. Here indeed lies the justest and most plausible objection against a considerable part of metaphysics that they are not properly a science but arise either from the fruitless eorts of human vanity which would penetrate into subjects utterly inacces sible to the understanding or from the craft of popular superstitions which being unable to defend themselves on fair ground raise these intangling brambles to cover and protect their weakness. Chaced from the open country these robbers y into the forest and lie in wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the mind and overwhelm it with religious fears and prejudices. The stoutest antagonist if he remit his watch a moment is oppressed. And many through cowardice and Of the Different Species of Philosophy 7 11 folly open the gates to the enemies and willingly receive them with reverence and submission as their legal sovereigns. But is this a sucient reason why philosophers should desist from such researches and leave superstition still in possession of her retreat Is it not proper to draw an opposite conclusion and perceive the necessity of carrying the war into the most secret recesses of the enemy In vain do we hope that men from frequent disappointment will at last abandon such airy sciences and discover the proper province of human reason. For besides that many persons nd too sensible an interest in perpetually recalling such topics besides this I say the motive of blind despair can never reasonably have place in the sciences since however unsuccessful former attempts may have proved there is still room to hope that the industry good fortune or improved sagacity of succeeding generations may reach discoveries unknown to former ages. Each adventurous genius will still leap at the arduous prize and nd himself stimulated rather than discouraged by the failures of his predecessors while he hopes that the glory of atchieving so hard an adventure is reserved for him alone. The only method of freeing learning at once from these abstruse questions is to enquire seriously into the nature of human understanding and shew from an exact analysis of its powers and capacity that it is by no means tted for such remote and abstruse subjects. We must submit to this fatigue in order to live at ease ever after And must cultivate true metaphysics with some care in order to destroy the false and adulterate. Indolence which to some persons aords a safe guard against this deceitful philosophy is with others overbalanced by curiosity and despair which at some moments prevails may give place afterwards to sanguine hopes and expectations. Accurate and just reasoning is the only catholic remedy tted for all persons and all dispositions and is alone able to subvert that abstruse philosophy and metaphysical jargon which being mixed up with popular superstition renders it in a manner impenetrable to careless reasoners and gives it the air of science and wisdom. Besides this advantage of rejecting after deliberate enquiry the most uncertain and disagreeable part of learning there are many positive advantages which result from an accurate scrutiny into the powers and faculties of human nature. It is remarkable concerning the operations of the mind that though most intimately present to us yet whenever they become the object of reection they seem Section I 8 12 13 involved in obscurity nor can the eye readily nd those lines and boundaries which discriminate and distinguish them. The objects are too ne to remain long in the same aspect or situation and must be apprehended in an instant by a superior penetration derived from nature and improved by habit and reection. It becomes therefore no inconsiderable part of science barely to know the dierent operations of the mind to separate them from each other to class them under their proper heads and to correct all that seeming disorder in which they lie involved when made the object of reection and enquiry. This task of ordering and distinguishing which has no merit when performed with regard to external bodies the objects of our senses rises in its value when directed towards the operations of the mind in proportion to the diculty and labour which we meet with in performing it. And if we can go no farther than this mental geography or delineation of the distinct parts and powers of the mind it is at least a satisfaction to go so far and the more obvious this science may appear and it is by no means obvious the more contemptible still must the ignorance of it be esteemed in all pretenders to learning and philosophy. Nor can there remain any suspicion that this science is uncertain and chimerical unless we should entertain such a scepti cism as is entirely subversive of all speculation and even action. It cannot be doubted that the mind is endowed with several powers and faculties that these powers are distinct from each other that what is really distinct to the immediate perception may be distin guished by reection and consequently that there is a truth and falsehood in all propositions on this subject and a truth and false hood which lie not beyond the compass of human understanding. There are many obvious distinctions of this kind such as those between the will and understanding the imagination and passions which fall within the comprehension of every human creature and the ner and more philosophical distinctions are no less real and certain though more dicult to be comprehended. Some instances especially late ones of success in these enquiries may give us a juster notion of the certainty and solidity of this branch of learning. And shall we esteem it worthy the labour of a philosopher to give us a true system of the planets and adjust the position and order of those remote bodies while we aect to overlook those who with so much success delineate the parts of the mind in which we are so intimately concerned Of the Different Species of Philosophy 9 14 But may we not hope that philosophy if cultivated with care and encouraged by the attention of the public may carry its researches still farther and discover at least in some degree the secret springs and principles by which the human mind is actuated in its operations Astronomers had long contented themselves with proving from the phaenomena the true motions order and magni tude of the heavenly bodies Till a philosopher at last arose who seems from the happiest reasoning to have also determined the laws and forces by which the revolutions of the planets are governed and directed. The like has been performed with regard to other parts of nature. And there is no reason to despair of equal success in our enquiries concerning the mental powers and oeconomy if prosecuted with equal capacity and caution. It is probable that one operation and principle of the mind depends on another which again may be resolved into one more general and universal And how far these researches may possibly be carried it will be dicult for us before or even after a careful trial exactly to determine. This is certain that attempts of this kind are every day made even by those who philoso phize the most negligently And nothing can be more requisite than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough care and attention that if it lie within the compass of human understanding it may at last be happily atchieved if not it may however be rejected with some condence and security. This last conclusion surely is not desirable nor ought it to be embraced too rashly. For how much must we dimin ish from the beauty and value of this species of philosophy upon such a supposition Moralists have hitherto been accustomed when they considered the vast multitude and diversity of those actions that excite our approbation or dislike to Search for some common principle on which this variety of sentiments might depend. And though they have sometimes carried the matter too far by their passion for some one general principle it must however be confessed that they are excus able in expecting to nd some general principles into which all the vices and virtues were justly to be resolved. The like has been the endeavour of critics logicians and even politicians Nor have their attempts been wholly unsuccessful though perhaps longer time greater accuracy and more ardent Application may bring these sciences still nearer their perfection. To throw up at once all pretensions of this kind may justly be deemed more rash precipitate and dogmatical than even the boldest and most armative philosophy that has ever attempted to impose its crude dictates and principles on mankind. Section I 10 15 What though these reasonings concerning human nature seem abstract and of dicult comprehension This aords no presumption of their falsehood. On the contrary it seems impossible that what has hitherto escaped so many wise and profound philosophers can be very obvious and easy. And whatever pains these researches may cost us we may think ourselves suciently rewarded not only in point of prot but of pleasure if by that means we can make any addition to our stock of knowledge in subjects of such unspeakable importance. But as after all the abstractedness of these speculations is no recommendation but rather a disadvantage to them and as this di culty may perhaps be surmounted by care and art and the avoiding of all unnecessary detail we have in the following enquiry attempted to throw some light upon subjects from which uncertainty has hith erto deterred the wise and obscurity the ignorant. Happy if we can unite the boundaries of the dierent species of philosophy by recon ciling profound enquiry with clearness and truth with novelty And still more happy if reasoning in this easy manner we can undermine the foundations of an abstruse philosophy which seems to have hith erto served only as a shelter to superstition and a cover to absurdity and error Of the Different Species of Philosophy 11 16 SECTION II Of the Origin of Ideas E very one will readily allow that there is a considerable dierence between the perceptions of the mind when a man feels the pain of excessive heat or the pleasure of moderate warmth and when he afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation or anticipates it by his imagination. These faculties may mimic or copy the perceptions of the senses but they never can entirely reach the force and vivacity of the original sentiment. The utmost we say of them even when they operate with greatest vigour is that they represent their object in so lively a manner that we could almost say we feel or see it But except the mind be disordered by disease or madness they never can arrive at such a pitch of vivacity as to render these perceptions altogether undistinguishable. All the colours of poetry however splendid can never paint natural objects in such a manner as to make the description be taken for a real landskip. The most lively thought is still inferior to the dullest sensation. We may observe a like distinction to run through all the other perceptions of the mind. A man in a t of anger is actuated in a very dierent manner from one who only thinks of that emotion. If you tell me that any person is in love I easily understand your meaning and form a just conception of his situation but never can mistake that conception for the real disorders and agitations of the passion. When we reect on our past sentiments and aections our thought is a faithful mirror and copies its objects truly but the colours which it employs are faint and dull in comparison of those in which our original perceptions were clothed. It requires no nice discernment or metaphysical head to mark the distinction between them. Here therefore we may divide all the perceptions of the mind into two classes or species which are distinguished by their dierent degrees of force and vivacity. The less forcible and lively are com monly denominated Thoughts or Ideas. The other species want a name in our language and in most others I suppose because it was not requisite for any but philosophical purposes to rank them under a general term or appellation. Let us therefore use a little freedom 17 18 and call them Impressions employing that word in a sense some what dierent from the usual. By the term impression then I mean all our more lively perceptions when we hear or see or feel or love or hate or desire or will. And impressions are distinguished from ideas which are the less lively perceptions of which we are conscious when we reect on any of those sensations or movements above mentioned. Nothing at rst view may seem more unbounded than the thought of man which not only escapes all human power and author ity but is not even restrained within the limits of nature and reality. To form monsters and join incongruous shapes and appearances costs the imagination no more trouble than to conceive the most natu ral and familiar objects. And while the body is conned to one planet along which it creeps with pain and diculty the thought can in an instant transport us into the most distant regions of the universe or even beyond the universe into the unbounded chaos where nature is supposed to lie in total confusion. What never was seen or heard of may yet be conceived nor is any thing beyond the power of thought except what implies an absolute contradiction. But though our thought seems to possess this unbounded liberty we shall nd upon a nearer examination that it is really conned within very narrow limits and that all this creative power of the mind amounts to no more than the faculty of compounding transposing augmenting or diminishing the materials aorded us by the senses and experience. When we think of a golden mountain we only join two consistent ideas gold and mountain with which we were formerly acquainted. A virtuous horse we can conceive because from our own feeling we can conceive virtue and this we may unite to the gure and shape of a horse which is an animal familiar to us. In short all the materials of thinking are derived either from our outward or inward sentiment The mixture and composition of these belongs alone to the mind and will. Or to express myself in philo sophical language all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of our impressions or more lively ones. To prove this the two following arguments will I hope be sucient. First when we analyse our thoughts or ideas however com pounded or sublime we always nd that they resolve themselves into such simple ideas as were copied from a precedent feeling or senti ment. Even those ideas which at rst view seem the most wide of this origin are found upon a nearer scrutiny to be derived from it. Of the Origin of Ideas 13 19 The idea of God as meaning an innitely intelligent wise and good Being arises from reecting on the operations of our own mind and augmenting without limit those qualities of goodness and wisdom. We may prosecute this enquiry to what length we please where we shall always nd that every idea which we examine is copied from a similar impression. Those who would assert that this position is not universally true nor without exception have only one and that an easy method of refuting it by producing that idea which in their opinion is not derived from this source. It will then be incumbent on us if we would maintain our doctrine to produce the impression or lively perception which corresponds to it. If it happen from a defect of the organ that a man is not susceptible of any species of sensation we always nd that he is as little susceptible of the correspondent ideas. A blind man can form no notion of colours a deaf man of sounds. Restore either of them that sense in which he is decient by opening this new inlet for his sensations you also open an inlet for the ideas and he nds no diculty in conceiving these objects. The case is the same if the object proper for exciting any sensation has never been applied to the organ. A Laplander or Negroe has no notion of the relish of wine. And though there are few or no instances of a like deciency in the mind where a person has never felt or is wholly incapable of a sentiment or passion that belongs to his species yet we nd the same observation to take place in a less degree. A man of mild manners can form no idea of inveterate revenge or cruelty nor can a selsh heart easily conceive the heights of friendship and generosity. It is readily allowed that other beings may possess many senses of which we can have no conception because the ideas of them have never been intro duced to us in the only manner by which an idea can have access to the mind to wit by the actual feeling and sensation. There is however one contradictory phaenomenon which may prove that it is not absolutely impossible for ideas to arise inde pendent of their correspondent impressions. I believe it will readily be allowed that the several distinct ideas of colour which enter by the eye or those of sound which are conveyed by the ear are really dierent from each other though at the same time resembling. Now if this be true of dierent colours it must be no less so of the dierent shades of the same colour and each shade produces a distinct idea independent of the rest. For if this should be denied it is possible by the continual gradation of shades to run a colour insensibly into what is most remote Section II 14 20 21 from it and if you will not allow any of the means to be dierent you cannot without absurdity deny the extremes to be the same. Suppose therefore a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years and to have become perfectly acquainted with colours of all kinds except one particular shade of blue for instance which it never has been his fortune to meet with. Let all the dierent shades of that colour except that single one be placed before him descending gradually from the deepest to the lightest it is plain that he will perceive a blank where that shade is wanting and will be sensible that there is a greater distance in that place between the contiguous colours than in any other. Now I ask whether it be possible for him from his own imagination to supply this deciency and raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade though it had never been conveyed to him by his senses I believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can And this may serve as a proof that the simple ideas are not always in every instance derived from the correspondent impres sions though this instance is so singular that it is scarcely worth our observing and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim. Here therefore is a proposition which not only seems in itself simple and intelligible but if a proper use were made of it might render every dispute equally intelligible and banish all that jargon which has so long taken possession of metaphysical reason ings and drawn disgrace upon them. All ideas especially abstract ones are naturally faint and obscure The mind has but a slender hold of them They are apt to be confounded with other resembling ideas and when we have often employed any term though without a distinct meaning we are apt to imagine it has a determinate idea annexed to it. On the contrary all impressions that is all sensations either outward or inward are strong and vivid The limits between them are more exactly determined Nor is it easy to fall into any error or mistake with regard to them. When we entertain therefore any suspicion that a philosophical term is employed without any mean ing or idea as is but too frequent we need but enquire from what impression is that supposed idea derived And if it be impossible to assign any this will serve to conrm our suspicion. By bringing ideas into so clear a light we may reasonably hope to remove all dispute which may arise concerning their nature an. Of the Origin of Ideas 15 22 1 See endnote p. SECTION III Of the Association of Ideas I t is evident that there is a principle of connexion between the dierent thoughts or ideas of the mind and that in their appear ance to the memory or imagination they introduce each other with a certain degree of method and regularity. In our more serious thinking or discourse this is so observable that any particular thought which breaks in upon the regular tract or chain of ideas is immediately remarked and rejected. And even in our wildest and most wandering reveries nay in our very dreams we shall nd if we reect that the imagination ran not altogether at adventures but that there was still a connexion upheld among the dierent ideas which succeeded each other. Were the loosest and freest conversation to be transcribed there would immediately be observed something which connected it in all its transitions. Or where this is wanting the person who broke the thread of discourse might still inform you that there had secretly revolved in his mind a succession of thought which had gradually led him from the subject of conversation. Among dierent languages even where we cannot suspect the least connexion or communication it is found that the words expressive of ideas the most compounded do yet nearly correspond to each other a certain proof that the simple ideas comprehended in the compound ones were bound together by some universal principle which had an equal inuence on all mankind. Though it be too obvious to escape observation that dierent ideas are connected together I do not nd that any philosopher has attempted to enumerate or class all the principles of association a subject however that seems worthy of curiosity. To me there appear to be only three principles of connexion among ideas namely Resemblance Contiguity in time or place and Cause or Eect. That these principles serve to connect ideas will not I believe be much doubted. A picture naturally leads our thoughts to the The mention of one apartment in a building naturally introduces an 23 24 2 Resemblance. But that this enumeration is compleat and that there are no other principles of association except these may be dicult to prove to the satisfaction of the reader or even to a mans own satisfaction. All we can do in such cases is to run over several instances and examine carefully the principle which binds the dierent thoughts to each other never stopping till we render the principle as general a. The more instances we examine and the more care we employ the more assurance shall we acquire that the enumeration which we form from the whole is compleat and entire. Of the Association of Ideas 17 3 Contiguity. Cause and eect. For instance Contrast or Contrariety is also a connexion among Ideas But it may perhaps be considered as a mixture of Causation and Resemblance. Where two objects are contrary the one destroys the other that is the cause of its annihilation and the idea of the annihilation of an object implies the idea of its former existence. SECTION IV Sceptical Doubts concerning the Operations of the Understanding PART I a ll the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds to wit Relations of Ideas and Matters of Fact. Of the rst kind are the sciences of Geometry Algebra and Arithmetic and in short every armation which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain. That the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the square of the two sides is a proposition which expresses a relation between these gures. That three times ve is equal to the half of thirty expresses a relation between these numbers. Propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere operation of thought without dependence on what is any where existent in the universe. Though there never were a circle or triangle in nature the truths demonstrated by Euclid would for ever retain their certainty and evidence. Matters of fact which are the second objects of human reason are not ascertained in the same manner nor is our evidence of their truth however great of a like nature with the foregoing. The con trary of every matter of fact is still possible because it can never imply a contradiction and is conceived by the mind with the same facility and distinctness as if ever so conformable to reality. That the sun will not rise tomorrow is no less intelligible a proposition and implies no more contradiction than the armation that it will rise. We should in vain therefore attempt to demonstrate its falsehood. Were it demonstratively false it would imply a contradiction and could never be distinctly conceived by the mind. It may therefore be a subject worthy of curiosity to enquire what is the nature of that evidence which assures us of any real existence and matter of fact beyond the present testimony of our senses or the records of our memory. This part of philosophy it is observable has been little cultivated either by the ancients or moderns and therefore our doubts and errors in the prosecution of so important an enquiry may be the more excusable while we march through such dicult 25 26 paths without any guide or direction. They may even prove useful by exciting curiosity and destroying that implicit faith and security which is the bane of all reasoning and free enquiry. The discovery of defects in the common philosophy if any such there be will not I presume be a discouragement but rather an incitement as is usual to attempt something more full and satisfactory than has yet been proposed to the public. All reasonings concerning matter of fact seem to be founded on the relation of Cause and Eect. By means of that relation alone we can go beyond the evidence of our memory and senses. If you were to ask a man why he believes any matter of fact which is absent for instance that his friend is in the country or in France he would give you a reason and this reason would be some other fact as a letter received from him or the knowledge of his former resolutions and promises. A man nding a watch or any other machine in a desart island would conclude that there had once been men in that island. All our reasonings concerning fact are of the same nature. And here it is constantly supposed that there is a connexion between the present fact and that which is inferred from it. Were there nothing to bind them together the inference would be entirely precarious. The hearing of an articulate voice and rational discourse in the dark assures us of the presence of some person Why because these are the eects of the human make and fabric and closely connected with it. If we anatomize all the other reasonings of this nature we shall nd that they are founded on the relation of cause and eect and that this relation is either near or remote direct or collateral. Heat and light are collateral eects of re and the one eect may justly be inferred from the other. If we would satisfy ourselves therefore concerning the nature of that evidence which assures us of matters of fact we must enquire how we arrive at the knowledge of cause and eect. I shall venture to arm as a general proposition which admits of no exception that the knowledge of this relation is not in any instance attained by reasonings priori but arises entirely from experience when we nd that any particular objects are constantly conjoined with each other. Let an object be presented to a man of ever so strong natural reason and abilities if that object be entirely new to him he will not be able by the most accurate examination of its sen sible qualities to discover any of its causes or eects. Adam though Sceptical Doubts 19 27 his rational faculties be supposed at the very rst entirely perfect could not have inferred from the uidity and transparency of water that it would suocate him or from the light and warmth of re that it would consume him. No object ever discovers by the qualities which appear to the senses either the causes which produced it or the eects which will arise from it nor can our reason unassisted by experience ever draw any inference concerning real existence and matter of fact. This proposition that causes and eects are discoverable not by reason but by experience will readily be admitted with regard to such objects as we remember to have once been altogether unknown to us since we must be conscious of the utter inability which we then lay under of foretelling what would arise from them. Present two smooth pieces of marble to a man who has no tincture of natural philosophy he will never discover that they will adhere together in such a manner as to require great force to separate them in a direct line while they make so small a resistance to a lateral pressure. Such events as bear little analogy to the common course of nature are also readily confessed to be known only by experience nor does any man imagine that the explosion of gunpowder or the attraction of a loadstone could ever be discovered by arguments priori. In like manner when an eect is supposed to depend upon an intricate machinery or secret structure of parts we make no diculty in attributing all our knowledge of it to experience. Who will assert that he can give the ultimate reason why milk or bread is proper nourishment for a man not for a lion or a tyger But the same truth may not appear at rst sight to have the same evidence with regard to events which have become familiar to us from our rst appearance in the world which bear a close analogy to the whole course of nature and which are supposed to depend on the simple qualities of objects without any secret structure of parts. We are apt to imagine that we could discover these eects by the mere operation of our reason without experience. We fancy that were we brought on a sudden into this world we could at rst have inferred that one Billiardball would communicate motion to another upon impulse and that we needed not to have waited for the event in order to pronounce with certainty concerning it. Such is the inuence of custom that where it is strongest it not only covers our natural ignorance but even conceals itself and seems not to take place merely because it is found in the highest degree. Section IV 20 28 29 But to convince us that all the laws of nature and all the oper ations of bodies without exception are known only by experience the following reections may perhaps suce. Were any object presented to us and were we required to pronounce concerning the eect which will result from it without consulting past observation after what manner I beseech you must the mind proceed in this operation It must invent or imagine some event which it ascribes to the object as its eect and it is plain that this invention must be entirely arbitrary. The mind can never possibly nd the eect in the supposed cause by the most accurate scrutiny and examination. For the eect is totally dierent from the cause and consequently can never be discovered in it. Motion in the second Billiardball is a quite distinct event from motion in the rst nor is there any thing in the one to suggest the smallest hint of the other. A stone or piece of metal raised into the air and left without any support immediately falls But to consider the matter priori is there any thing we discover in this situation which can beget the idea of a downward rather than an upward or any other motion in the stone or metal And as the rst imagination or invention of a particular eect in all natural operations is arbitrary where we consult not experience so must we also esteem the supposed tye or connexion between the cause and eect which binds them together and renders it impossi ble that any other eect could result from the operation of that cause. When I see for instance a Billiardball moving in a straight line towards another even suppose motion in the second ball should by accident be suggested to me as the result of their contact or impulse may I not conceive that a hundred dierent events might as well follow from that cause May not both these balls remain at absolute rest May not the rst ball return in a straight line or leap ofrom the second in any line or direction All these suppositions are consis tent and conceivable. Why then should we give the preference to one which is no more consistent or conceivable than the rest All our reasonings priori will never be able to shew us any foundation for this preference. In a word then every eect is a distinct event from its cause. It could not therefore be discovered in the cause and the rst inven tion or conception of it priori must be entirely arbitrary. And even after it is suggested the conjunction of it with the cause must appear equally arbitrary since there are always many other eects which to Sceptical Doubts 21 30 reason must seem fully as consistent and natural. In vain therefore should we pretend to determine any single event or infer any cause or eect without the assistance of observation and experience. Hence we may discover the reason why no philosopher who is rational and modest has ever pretended to assign the ultimate cause of any natural operation or to show distinctly the action of that power which produces any single eect in the universe. It is confessed that the utmost eort of human reason is to reduce the principles produc tive of natural phaenomena to a greater simplicity and to resolve the many particular eects into a few general causes by means of reason ings from analogy experience and observation. But as to the causes of these general causes we should in vain attempt their discovery nor shall we ever be able to satisfy ourselves by any particular expli cation of them. These ultimate springs and principles are totally shut up from human curiosity and enquiry. Elasticity gravity cohesion of parts communication of motion by impulse these are probably the ultimate causes and principles which we shall ever discover in nature and we may esteem ourselves suciently happy if by accurate enquiry and reasoning we can trace up the particular phaenomena to or near to these general principles. The most perfect philosophy of the natu ral kind only staves oour ignorance a little longer As perhaps the most perfect philosophy of the moral or metaphysical kind serves only to discover larger portions of it. Thus the observation of human blind ness and weakness is the result of all philosophy and meets us at every turn in spite of our endeavours to elude or avoid it. Nor is geometry when taken into the assistance of natural philosophy ever able to remedy this defect or lead us into the know ledge of ultimate causes by all that accuracy of reasoning for which it is so justly celebrated. Every part of mixed mathematics proceeds upon the supposition that certain laws are established by nature in her operations and abstract reasonings are employed either to assist ex perience in the discovery of these laws or to determine their inuence in particular instances where it depends upon any precise degree of distance and quantity. Thus it is a law of motion discovered by ex perience that the moment or force of any body in motion is in the compound ratio or proportion of its solid contents and its velocity and consequently that a small force may remove the greatest obstacle or raise the greatest weight if by any contrivance or machinery we can encrease the velocity of that force so as to make it an overmatch for Section IV 22 31 its antagonist. Geometry assists us in the Application of this law by giving us the just dimensions of all the parts and gures which can enter into any species of machine but still the discovery of the law itself is owing merely to experience and all the abstract reasonings in the world could never lead us one step towards the knowledge of it. When we reason priori and consider merely any object or cause as it appears to the mind independent of all observation it never could suggest to us the notion of any distinct object such as its eect much less shew us the inseparable and inviolable connection between them. A man must be very sagacious who could discover by reasoning that crystal is the eect of heat and ice of cold without being previously acquainted with the operation of these qualities. PART II But we have not yet attained any tolerable satisfaction with regard to the question rst proposed. Each solution still gives rise to a new question as dicult as the foregoing and leads us on to farther enquiries. When it is asked What is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact the proper answer seems to be that they are founded on the relation of cause and eect. When again it is asked What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation it may be replied in one word Experience. But if we still carry on our sifting humour and ask What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience this implies a new question which may be of more dicult solution and explication. Philosophers that give themselves airs of superior wisdom and suciency have a hard task when they encounter persons of inquisitive dispositions who push them from every corner to which they retreat and who are sure at last to bring them to some dangerous dilemma. The best expe dient to prevent this confusion is to be modest in our pretensions and even to discover the diculty ourselves before it is objected to us. By this means we may make a kind of merit of our very ignorance. I shall content myself in this section with an easy task and shall pretend only to give a negative answer to the question here pro posed. I say then that even after we have experience of the operations of cause and eect our conclusions from that experience are not founded on reasoning or any process of the understanding. This answer we must endeavour both to explain and to defend. Sceptical Doubts 23 32 It must certainly be allowed that nature has kept us at a great distance from all her secrets and has aorded us only the knowledge of a few supercial qualities of objects while she conceals from us those powers and principles on which the inuence of these objects entirely depends. Our senses inform us of the colour weight and consistence of bread but neither sense nor reason can ever inform us of those qualities which t it for the nourishment and support of a human body. Sight or feeling conveys an idea of the actual motion of bodies but as to that wonderful force or power which would carry on a moving body for ever in a continued change of place and which bodies never lose but by communicating it to others of this we cannot form the most distant conception. But notwithstanding this ignorance of natural and principles we always presume when we see like sensible qualities that they have like secret powers and expect that eects similar to those which we have experienced will follow from them. If a body of like colour and consistence with that bread which we have formerly eat be presented to us we make no scruple of repeating the experiment and foresee with certainty like nourishment and support. Now this is a process of the mind or thought of which I would willingly know the foundation. It is allowed on all hands that there is no known connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret powers and consequently that the mind is not led to form such a conclusion concerning their constant and regular conjunction by any thing which it knows of their nature. As to past Experience it can be allowed to give direct and certain infor mation of those precise objects only and that precise period of time which fell under its cognizance But why this experience should be extended to future times and to other objects which for aught we know may be only in appearance similar this is the main question on which I would insist. The bread which I formerly eat nourished me that is a body of such sensible qualities was at that time endued with such secret powers But does it follow that other bread must also nourish me at another time and that like sensible qualities must always be attended with like secret powers The consequence seems nowise necessary. At least it must be acknowledged that there is here a consequence drawn by the mind that there is a certain step Section IV 24 33 34 7 The word Power is here used in a loose and popular sense. The more accurate explication of it would give additional evidence to this argument. See Sect. These two propositions are far from being the same I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an eect and I foresee that other objects which are in appearance similar will be attended with similar eects. I shall allow if you please that the one proposition may justly be inferred from the other I know in fact that it always is inferred. But if you insist that the inference is made by a chain of reasoning I desire you to produce that reasoning. The connexion between these propositions is not intuitive. There is required a medium which may enable the mind to draw such an inference if indeed it be drawn by reasoning and argument. What that medium is I must confess passes my comprehension and it is incumbent on those to produce it who assert that it really exists and is the origin of all our conclusions concerning matter of fact. This negative argument must certainly in process of time become altogether convincing if many penetrating and able philoso phers shall turn their enquiries this way and no one be ever able to discover any connecting proposition or intermediate step which sup ports the understanding in this conclusion. But as the question is yet new every reader may not trust so far to his own penetration as to conclude because an argument escapes his enquiry that therefore it does not really exist. For this reason it may be requisite to venture upon a more dicult task and enumerating all the branches of human knowledge endeavour to shew that none of them can aord such an argument. All reasonings may be divided into two kinds namely demon strative reasoning or that concerning relations of ideas and moral reasoning or that concerning matter of fact and existence. That there are no demonstrative arguments in the case seems evident since it implies no contradiction that the course of nature may change and that an object seemingly like those which we have experienced may be attended with dierent or contrary eects. May I not clearly and distinctly conceive that a body falling from the clouds and which in all other respects resembles snow has yet the taste of salt or feeling of re Is there any more intelligible proposition than to arm that all the trees will ourish in December and January and decay in May and June Now whatever is intelligible and can be distinctly conceived implies no contradiction and can never be proved false by any demonstrative argument or abstract reasoning priori. Sceptical Doubts 25 35 If we be therefore engaged by arguments to put trust in past experience and make it the standard of our future judgment these arguments must be probable only or such as regard matter of fact and real existence according to the division above mentioned. But that there is no argument of this kind must appear if our explication of that species of reasoning be admitted as solid and satisfactory. We have said that all arguments concerning existence are founded on the relation of cause and eect that our knowledge of that relation is derived entirely from experience and that all our experimental conclusions proceed upon the supposition that the future will be conformable to the past. To endeavour therefore the proof of this last supposition by probable arguments or arguments regarding exis tence must be evidently going in a circle and taking that for granted which is the very point in question. In reality all arguments from experience are founded on the similarity which we discover among natural objects and by which we are induced to expect eects similar to those which we have found to follow from such objects. And though none but a fool or madman will ever pretend to dispute the authority of experience or to reject that great guide of human life it may surely be allowed a philosopher to have so much curiosity at least as to examine the principle of human nature which gives this mighty authority to experience and makes us draw advantage from that similarity which nature has placed among dierent objects. From causes which appear similar we expect similar eects. This is the sum of all our experimental conclusions. Now it seems evident that if this conclusion were formed by reason it would be as perfect at rst and upon one instance as after ever so long a course of experience. But the case is far otherwise. Nothing so like as eggs yet no one on account of this appearing similarity expects the same taste and relish in all of them. It is only after a long course of uniform experiments in any kind that we attain a rm reliance and security with regard to a particular event. Now where is that process of reasoning which from one instance draws a conclusion so dierent from that which it infers from a hundred instances that are nowise dierent from that single one This question I propose as much for the sake of information as with an intention of raising diculties. I cannot nd I cannot imagine any such reasoning. But I keep my mind still open to instruction if any one will vouchsafe to bestow it on me. Section IV 26 36 Should it be said that from a number of uniform experiments we infer a connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret powers this I must confess seems the same diculty couched in dierent terms. The question still recurs on what process of argument this inference is founded Where is the medium the interposing ideas which join propositions so very wide of each other It is confessed that the colour consistence and other sensible qualities of bread appear not of themselves to have any connexion with the secret powers of nour ishment and support. For otherwise we could infer these secret powers from the rst appearance of these sensible qualities without the aid of experience contrary to the sentiment of all philosophers and contrary to plain matter of fact. Here then is our natural state of ignorance with regard to the powers and inuence of all objects. How is this reme died by experience It only shews us a number of uniform eects resulting from certain objects and teaches us that those particular objects at that particular time were endowed with such powers and forces. When a new object endowed with similar sensible qualities is produced we expect similar powers and forces and look for a like eect. From a body of like colour and consistence with bread we expect like nourishment and support. But this surely is a step or progress of the mind which wants to be explained. When a man says I have found in all past instances such sensible qualities conjoined with such secret powers And when he says similar sensible qualities will always be conjoined with similar secret powers he is not guilty of a tautol ogy nor are these propositions in any respect the same. You say that the one proposition is an inference from the other. But you must con fess that the inference is not intuitive neither is it demonstrative Of what nature is it then To say it is experimental is begging the ques tion. For all inferences from experience suppose as their foundation that the future will resemble the past and that similar powers will be conjoined with similar sensible qualities. If there be any suspicion that the course of nature may change and that the past may be no rule for the future all experience becomes useless and can give rise to no inference or conclusion. It is impossible therefore that any arguments from experience can prove this resemblance of the past to the future since all these arguments are founded on the supposition of that resemblance. Let the course of things be allowed hitherto ever so regular that alone without some new argument or inference proves not that for the future it will continue so. In vain do you pretend to Sceptical Doubts 27 37 38 have learned the nature of bodies from your past experience. Their secret nature and consequently all their eects and inuence may change without any change in their sensible qualities. This happens sometimes and with regard to some objects Why may it not happen always and with regard to all objects What logic what process of argument secures you against this supposition My practice you say refutes my doubts. But you mistake the purport of my question. As an agent I am quite satised in the point but as a philosopher who has some share of curiosity I will not say scepticism I want to learn the foundation of this inference. No reading no enquiry has yet been able to remove my diculty or give me satisfaction in a matter of such importance. Can I do better than propose the diculty to the public even though perhaps I have small hopes of obtaining a solution We shall at least by this means be sensible of our ignorance if we do not augment our knowledge. I must confess that a man is guilty of unpardonable arrogance who concludes because an argument has escaped his own investigation that therefore it does not really exist. I must also confess that though all the learned for several ages should have employed themselves in fruitless Search upon any subject it may still perhaps be rash to conclude positively that the subject must therefore pass all human comprehension. Even though we examine all the sources of our know ledge and conclude them unt for such a subject there may still remain a suspicion that the enumeration is not compleat or the examination not accurate. But with regard to the present subject there are some considerations which seem to remove all this accusation of arrogance or suspicion of mistake. It is certain that the most ignorant and stupid peasants nay infants nay even brute beasts improve by experience and learn the qualities of natural objects by observing the eects which result from them. When a child has felt the sensation of pain from touching the ame of a candle he will be careful not to put his hand near any candle but will expect a similar eect from a cause which is similar in its sensible qualities and appearance. If you assert therefore that the understanding of the child is led into this conclusion by any process of argument or ratiocination I may justly require you to produce that argument nor have you any pretence to refuse so equitable a demand. You cannot say that the argument is abstruse and may possibly escape your enquiry since you confess that it is obvious to the capacity of Section IV 28 39 a mere infant. If you hesitate therefore a moment or if after reection you produce any intricate or profound argument you in a manner give up the question and confess that it is not reasoning which engages us to suppose the past resembling the future and to expect similar eects from causes which are to appearance similar. This is the proposition which I intended to enforce in the present section. If I be right I pretend not to have made any mighty discovery. And if I be wrong I must acknowledge myself to be indeed a very backward scholar since I cannot now discover an argument which it seems was perfectly familiar to me long before I was out of my cradle. Sceptical Doubts 29 SECTION V Sceptical Solution of these Doubts PART I T he passion for philosophy like that for religion seems liable to this inconvenience that though it aims at the correction of our manners and extirpation of our vices it may only serve by imprudent management to foster a predominant inclination and push the mind with more determined resolution towards that side which already draws too much by the biass and propensity of the natural temper. It is certain that while we aspire to the magnanimous rmness of the philosophic sage and endeavour to conne our pleasures altogether within our own minds we may at last render our philosophy like that of Epictetus and other Stoics only a more rened system of selshness and reason ourselves out of all virtue as well as social enjoyment. While we study with attention the vanity of human life and turn all our thoughts towards the empty and transitory nature of riches and honours we are perhaps all the while attering our natural indolence which hating the bustle of the world and drudg ery of business seeks a pretence of reason to give itself a full and uncontrouled indulgence. There is however one species of philoso phy which seems little liable to this inconvenience and that because it strikes in with no disorderly passion of the human mind nor can mingle itself with any natural aection or propensity and that is the Academic or Sceptical philosophy. The academics always talk of doubt and suspense of judgment of danger in hasty determinations of conning to very narrow bounds the enquiries of the understanding and of renouncing all speculations which lie not within the limits of common life and practice. Nothing therefore can be more contrary than such a philosophy to the supine indolence of the mind its rash arrogance its lofty pretensions and its superstitious credulity. Every passion is mortied by it except the love of truth and that passion never is nor can be carried to too high a degree. It is surprising there fore that this philosophy which in almost every instance must be harmless and innocent should be the subject of so much groundless 40 41 reproach and obloquy. But perhaps the very circumstance which renders it so innocent is what chiey exposes it to the public hatred and resentment. By attering no irregular passion it gains few partizans By opposing so many vices and follies it raises to itself abundance of enemies who stigmatize it as libertine profane and irreligious. Nor need we fear that this philosophy while it endeavours to limit our enquiries to common life should ever undermine the reason ings of common life and carry its doubts so far as to destroy all action as well as speculation. Nature will always maintain her rights and prevail in the end over any abstract reasoning whatsoever. Though we should conclude for instance as in the foregoing section that in all reasonings from experience there is a step taken by the mind which is not supported by any argument or process of the understanding there is no danger that these reasonings on which almost all knowledge depends will ever be aected by such a discovery. If the mind be not engaged by argument to make this step it must be induced by some other principle of equal weight and authority and that principle will preserve its inuence as long as human nature remains the same. What that principle is may well be worth the pains of enquiry. Suppose a person though endowed with the strongest faculties of reason and reection to be brought on a sudden into this world he would indeed immediately observe a continual succession of objects and one event following another but he would not be able to discover any thing farther. He would not at rst by any reasoning be able to reach the idea of cause and eect since the particular powers by which all natural operations are performed never appear to the senses nor is it reasonable to conclude merely because one event in one instance precedes another that therefore the one is the cause the other the eect. Their conjunction may be arbitrary and casual. There may be no reason to infer the existence of one from the appearance of the other. And in a word such a person without more experience could never employ his conjecture or reasoning concerning any matter of fact or be assured of any thing beyond what was immediately present to his memory and senses. Suppose again that he has acquired more experience and has lived so long in the world as to have observed similar objects or events to be constantly conjoined together what is the consequence of this experience He immediately infers the existence of one object from the appearance of the other. Yet he has not by all his experience Sceptical Solution of these Doubts 31 42 acquired any idea or knowledge of the secret power by which the one object produces the other nor is it by any process of reasoning he is engaged to draw this inference. But still he nds himself determined to draw it And though he should be convinced that his understand ing has no part in the operation he would nevertheless continue in the same course of thinking. There is some other principle which determines him to form such a conclusion. This principle is Custom or Habit. For wherever the repetition of any particular act or operation produces a propensity to renew the same act or operation without being impelled by any reason ing or process of the understanding we always say that this propensity is the eect of Custom. By employing that word we pretend not to have given the ultimate reason of such a propensity. We only point out a principle of human nature which is universally acknowledged and which is well known by its eects. Perhaps we can push our enquiries no farther or pretend to give the cause of this cause but must rest contented with it as the ultimate principle which we can assign of all our conclusions from experience. It is sucient satisfaction that we can go so far without repining at the narrowness of our faculties because they will carry us no farther. And it is certain we here advance a very intelligible proposition at least if not a true one when we assert that after the constant conjunction of two objects heat and ame for instance weight and solidity we are determined by custom alone to expect the one from the appearance of the other. This hypothesis seems even the only one which explains the diculty why we draw from a thousand instances an inference which we are not able to draw from one instance that is in no respect dierent from them. Reason is incapable of any such variation. The conclusions which it draws from considering one circle are the same which it would form upon surveying all the circles in the universe. But no man having seen only one body move after being impelled by another could infer that every other body will move after a like impulse. All inferences from experience therefore are eects of custom not o. Custom then is the great guide of human life. It is that prin ciple alone which renders our experience useful to us and makes us expect for the future a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past. Without the inuence of custom we should be Section V 32 43 44 45 8 See endnote p. We should never know how to adjust means to ends or to employ our natural powers in the produc tion of any eect. There would be an end at once of all action as well as of the chief part of speculation. But here it may be proper to remark that though our conclu sions from experience carry us beyond our memory and senses and assure us of matters of fact which happened in the most distant places and most remote ages yet some fact must always be present to the senses or memory from which we may rst proceed in drawing these conclusions. A man who should nd in a desert country the remains of pompous buildings would conclude that the country had in ancient times been cultivated by civilized inhabitants but did nothing of this nature occur to him he could never form such an inference. We learn the events of former ages from history but then we must peruse the volumes in which this instruction is contained and thence carry up our inferences from one testimony to another till we arrive at the eyewitnesses and spectators of these distant events. In a word if we proceed not upon some fact present to the memory or senses our reasonings would be merely hypothetical and however the particular links might be connected with each other the whole chain of inferences would have nothing to support it nor could we ever by its means arrive at the knowledge of any real exis tence. If I ask why you believe any particular matter of fact which you relate you must tell me some reason and this reason will be some other fact connected with it. But as you cannot proceed after this manner in innitum you must at last terminate in some fact which is present to your memory or senses or must allow that your belief is entirely without foundation. What then is the conclusion of the whole matter a simple one though it must be confessed pretty remote from the common theories of philosophy. All belief of matter of fact or real existence is derived merely from some object present to the memory or senses and a customary conjunction between that and some other object. Or in other words having found in many instances that any two kinds of objects ame and heat snow and cold have always been conjoined together if ame or snow be presented anew to the senses the mind is carried by custom to expect heat or cold and to believe that such a quality does exist and will discover itself upon a nearer approach. Sceptical Solution of these Doubts 33 46 This belief is the necessary result of placing the mind in such circum stances. It is an operation of the soul when we are so situated as unavoidable as to feel the passion of love when we receive benets or hatred when we meet with injuries. All these operations are a species of natural instincts which no reasoning or process of the thought and understanding is able either to produce or to prevent. At this point it would be very allowable for us to stop our philo sophical researches. In most questions we can never make a single step farther and in all questions we must terminate here at last after our most restless and curious enquiries. But still our curiosity will be pardonable perhaps commendable if it carry us on to still farther researches and make us examine more accurately the nature of this belief and of the customary conjunction whence it is derived. By this means we may meet with some explications and analogies that will give satisfaction at least to such as love the abstract sciences and can be entertained with speculations which however accurate may still retain a degree of doubt and uncertainty. As to readers of a dierent taste the remaining part of this section is not calculated for them and the follow ing enquiries may well be understood though it be neglected. PART II Nothing is more free than the imagination of man and though it cannot exceed that original stock of ideas furnished by the internal and external senses it has unlimited power of mixing compounding separating and dividing these ideas in all the varieties of ction and vision. It can feign a train of events with all the appearance of reality ascribe to them a particular time and place conceive them as existent and paint them out to itself with every circumstance that belongs to any historical fact which it believes with the greatest certainty. Wherein therefore consists the dierence between such a ction and belief It lies not merely in any peculiar idea which is annexed to such a conception as commands our assent and which is wanting to every known ction. For as the mind has authority over all its ideas it could voluntarily annex this particular idea to any ction and consequently be able to believe whatever it pleases contrary to what we nd by daily experience. We can in our conception join the head of a man to the body of a horse but it is not in our power to believe that such an animal has ever really existed. Section V 34 47 48 It follows therefore that the dierence between ction and belief lies in some sentiment or feeling which is annexed to the latter not to the former and which depends not on the will nor can be commanded at pleasure. It must be excited by nature like all other sentiments and must arise from the particular situation in which the mind is placed at any particular juncture. Whenever any object is presented to the memory or senses it immediately by the force of custom carries the imagination to conceive that object which is usu ally conjoined to it and this conception is attended with a feeling or sentiment dierent from the loose reveries of the fancy. In this consists the whole nature of belief. For as there is no matter of fact which we believe so rmly that we cannot conceive the contrary there would be no dierence between the conception assented to and that which is rejected were it not for some sentiment which distinguishes the one from the other. If I see a billiardball moving towards another on a smooth table I can easily conceive it to stop upon contact. This conception implies no contradiction but still it feels very dierently from that conception by which I represent to myself the impulse and the communication of motion from one ball to another. Were we to attempt a denition of this sentiment we should perhaps nd it a very dicult if not an impossible task in the same manner as if we should endeavour to dene the feeling of cold or pas sion of anger to a creature who never had any experience of these sentiments. Belief is the true and proper name of this feeling and no one is ever at a loss to know the meaning of that term because every man is every moment conscious of the sentiment represented by it. It may not however be improper to attempt a description of this sentiment in hopes we may by that means arrive at some analogies which may aord a more perfect explication of it. I say then that belief is nothing but a more vivid lively forcible rm steady conception of an object than what the imagination alone is ever able to attain. This variety of terms which may seem so unphilosophical is intended only to express that act of the mind which renders realities or what is taken for such more present to us than ctions causes them to weigh more in the thought and gives them a superior inuence on the passions and imagination. Provided we agree about the thing it is needless to dispute about the terms. The imagination has the command over all its ideas and can join and mix and vary them in all the ways possible. It may conceive ctitious Sceptical Solution of these Doubts 35 49 objects with all the circumstances of place and time. It may set them in a manner before our eyes in their true colours just as they might have existed. But as it is impossible that this faculty of imagination can ever of itself reach belief it is evident that belief consists not in the peculiar nature or order of ideas but in the manner of their conception and in their feeling to the mind. I confess that it is impossible perfectly to explain this feeling or manner of conception. We may make use of words which express something near it. But its true and proper name as we observed before is belief which is a term that every one suciently understands in common life. And in philos ophy we can go no farther than assert that belief is something felt by the mind which distinguishes the ideas of the judgment from the ctions of the imagination. It gives them more weight and inuence makes them appear of greater importance inforces them in the mind and renders them the governing principle of our actions. I hear at pres ent for instance a persons voice with whom I am acquainted and the sound comes as from the next room. This impression of my senses immediately conveys my thought to the person together with all the surrounding objects. I paint them out to myself as existing at present with the same qualities and relations of which I formerly knew them possessed. These ideas take faster hold of my mind than ideas of an enchanted castle. They are very dierent to the feeling and have a much greater inuence of every kind either to give pleasure or pain joy or sorrow. Let us then take in the whole compass of this doctrine and allow that the sentiment of belief is nothing but a conception more intense and steady than what attends the mere ctions of the imagi nation and that this manner of conception arises from a customary conjunction of the object with something present to the memory or senses I believe that it will not be dicult upon these suppositions to nd other operations of the mind analogous to it and to trace up these phaenomena to principles still more general. We have already observed that nature has established con nexions among particular ideas and that no sooner one idea occurs to our thoughts than it introduces its correlative and carries our attention towards it by a gentle and insensible movement. These principles of connexion or association we have reduced to three namely Resemblance Contiguity and Causation which are the only bonds that unite our thoughts together and beget that regular train Section V 36 50 of reection or discourse which in a greater or less degree takes place among all mankind. Now here arises a question on which the solution of the present diculty will depend. Does it happen in all these relations that when one of the objects is presented to the senses or memory the mind is not only carried to the conception of the correlative but reaches a steadier and stronger conception of it than what otherwise it would have been able to attain This seems to be the case with that belief which arises from the relation of cause and eect. And if the case be the same with the other relations or prin ciples of association this may be established as a general law which takes place in all the operations of the mind. We may therefore observe as the rst experiment to our present purpose that upon the appearance of the picture of an absent friend our idea of him is evidently enlivened by the resem blance and that every passion which that idea occasions whether of joy or sorrow acquires new force and vigour. In producing this eect there concur both a relation and a present impression. Where the picture bears him no resemblance at least was not intended for him it never so much as conveys our thought to him And where it is absent as well as the person though the mind may pass from the thought of the one to that of the other it feels its idea to be rather weakened than enlivened by that transition. We take a pleasure in viewing the picture of a friend when it is set before us but when it is removed rather chuse to consider him directly than by reection in an image which is equally distant and obscure. The ceremonies of the Roman Catholic religion may be considered as instances of the same nature. The devotees of that superstition usually plead in excuse for the mummeries with which they are upbraided that they feel the good eect of those external motions and postures and actions in enlivening their devotion and quickening their fervour which otherwise would decay if directed entirely to distant and immaterial objects. We shadow out the objects of our faith say they in sensible types and images and render them more present to us by the immediate presence of these types than it is possible for us to do merely by an intellectual view and contempla tion. Sensible objects have always a greater inuence on the fancy than any other and this inuence they readily convey to those ideas to which they are related and which they resemble. I shall only infer from these practices and this reasoning that the eect of resemblance Sceptical Solution of these Doubts 37 51 52 in enlivening the ideas is very common and as in every case a resem blance and a present impression must concur we are abundantly sup plied with experiments to prove the reality of the foregoing principle. We may add force to these experiments by others of a dierent kind in considering the eects of contiguity as well as of resemblance. It is certain that distance diminishes the force of every idea and that upon our approach to any object though it does not discover itself to our senses it operates upon the mind with an inuence which imitates an immediate impression. The thinking on any object readily transports the mind to what is contiguous but it is only the actual presence of an object that transports it with a superior vivacity. When I am a few miles from home whatever relates to it touches me more nearly than when I am two hundred leagues distant though even at that distance the reecting on any thing in the neighbourhood of my friends or family naturally produces an idea of them. But as in this latter case both the objects of the mind are ideas notwithstanding there is an easy transition between them that transition alone is not able to give a superior vivacity to any of the ideas for want of some immediat. No one can doubt but causation has the same inuence as the other two relations of resemblance and contiguity. Superstitious people are fond of the reliques of saints and holy men for the same reason that they seek after types or images in order to enliven their devotion and give them a more intimate and strong conception of those exemplary lives which they desire to imitate. Now it is evi dent that one of the best reliques which a devotee could procure would be the handywork of a saint and if his cloaths and furniture are ever to be considered in this light it is because they were once at his disposal and were moved and aected by him in which respect they are to be considered as imperfect eects and as connected with Section V 38 53 9 Naturane nobis inquit datum dicam an errore quodam ut cum ea loca videamus in quibus memoria dignos viros acceperimus multum esse versatos magis moveamur quam siquando eorum ipsorum aut facta audiamus aut scriptum aliquod legamus Velut ego nunc moveor. Venit enim mihi Platonis in mentem quem accepimus primum hc disputare solitum Cujus etiam illi hortuli propinqui non memoriam solum mihi aerunt sed ipsum videntur in conspectu meo hc ponere. Hic Speusippus hic Xenocrates hic ejus auditor Polemo cujus ipsa illa sessio fuit quam videamus. Equidem etiam curiam nostram Hostiliam dico non hanc novam quae mihi minor esse videtur postquam est major solebam intuens Scipionem Catonem Laelium nostrum vero in primis avum cogitare. Tanta vis admonitionis est in locis ut non sine causa ex his memoriae deducta sit disciplina. Cicero de Finibus. Suppose that the son of a friend who had been long dead or absent were presented to us it is evident that this object would instantly revive its correlative idea and recal to our thoughts all past intimacies and familiarities in more lively colours than they would otherwise have appeared to us. This is another phaenomenon which seems to prove the principle abovementioned. We may observe that in these phaenomena the belief of the correlative object is always presupposed without which the relation could have no eect. The inuence of the picture supposes that we believe our friend to have once existed. Contiguity to home can never excite our ideas of home unless we believe that it really exists. Now I assert that this belief where it reaches beyond the memory or senses is of a similar nature and arises from similar causes with the transition of thought and vivacity of conception here explained. When I throw a piece of dry wood into a re my mind is immedi ately carried to conceive that it augments not extinguishes the ame. This transition of thought from the cause to the eect pro ceeds not from reason. It derives its origin altogether from custom and experience. And as it rst begins from an object present to the senses it renders the idea or conception of ame more strong and lively than any loose oating reverie of the imagination. That idea arises immediately. The thought moves instantly towards it and conveys to it all that force of conception which is derived from the impression present to the senses. When a sword is levelled at my breast does not the idea of wound and pain strike me more strongly than when a glass of wine is presented to me even though by accident this idea should occur after the appearance of the latter object But what is there in this whole matter to cause such a strong conception except only a present object and a customary transition to the idea of another object which we have been accustomed to conjoin with the former This is the whole operation of the mind in all our conclu sions concerning matter of fact and existence and it is a satisfaction to nd some analogies by which it may be explained. The transition from a present object does in all cases give strength and solidity to the related idea. Here then is a kind of preestablished harmony between the course of nature and the succession of our ideas and though the powers Sceptical Solution of these Doubts 39 54 and forces by which the former is governed be wholly unknown to us yet our thoughts and conceptions have still we nd gone on in the same train with the other works of nature. Custom is that principle by which this correspondence has been eected so necessary to the subsistence of our species and the regulation of our conduct in every circumstance and occurrence of human life. Had not the presence of an object instantly excited the idea of those objects commonly conjoined with it all our knowledge must have been limited to the narrow sphere of our memory and senses and we should never have been able to adjust means to ends or employ our natural powers either to the producing of good or avoiding of evil. Those who delight in the discovery and contemplation of nal causes have here ample subject to employ their wonder and admiration. I shall add for a further conrmation of the foregoing theory that as this operation of the mind by which we infer like eects from like causes and vice versa is so essential to the subsistence of all human creatures it is not probable that it could be trusted to the fallacious deductions of our reason which is slow in its operations appears not in any degree during the rst years of infancy and at best is in every age and period of human life extremely liable to error and mistake. It is more conformable to the ordinary wisdom of nature to secure so necessary an act of the mind by some instinct or mechanical tendency which may be infallible in its operations may discover itself at the rst appearance of life and thought and may be independent of all the laboured deductions of the understanding. As nature has taught us the use of our limbs without giving us the knowledge of the muscles and nerves by which they are actuated so has she implanted in us an instinct which carries forward the thought in a correspondent course to that which she has established among external objects though we are ignorant of those powers and forces on which this regular course and succession of objects totally depends. Section V 40 55 SECTION VI Of T hough there be no such thing as Chance in the world our ignorance of the real cause of any event has the same inuence on the understanding and begets a like species of belief or opinion. There is certainly a probability which arises from a superiority of chances on any side and according as this superiority encreases and surpasses the opposite chances the probability receives a proportion able encrease and begets still a higher degree of belief or assent to that side in which we discover the superiority. If a dye were marked with one gure or number of spots on four sides and with another gure or number of spots on the two remaining sides it would be more prob able that the former would turn up than the latter though if it had a thousand sides marked in the same manner and only one side dierent the probability would be much higher and our belief or expectation of the event more steady and secure. This process of the thought or rea soning may seem trivial and obvious but to those who consider it more narrowly it may perhaps aord matter for curious speculation. It seems evident that when the mind looks forward to dis cover the event which may result from the throw of such a dye it considers the turning up of each particular side as alike probable and this is the very nature of chance to render all the particular events comprehended in it entirely equal. But nding a greater number of sides concur in the one event than in the other the mind is carried more frequently to that event and meets it oftener in revolving the various possibilities or chances on which the ultimate result depends. This concurrence of several views in one particular event begets immediately by an inexplicable contrivance of nature the sentiment of belief and gives that event the advantage over its antagonist which is supported by a smaller number of views and recurs less frequently 56 57 10 Mr. Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. In this view we must say that it is only probable all men must die or that the sun will rise tomorrow. But to conform our language more to common use we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations proofs and probabilities. By proofs meaning such arguments from experience as leave no room for doubt or opposition. If we allow that belief is nothing but a rmer and stronger conception of an object than what attends the mere ctions of the imag ination this operation may perhaps in some measure be accounted for. The concurrence of these several views or glimpses imprints the idea more strongly on the imagination gives it superior force and vigour renders its inuence on the passions and aections more sen sible and in a word begets that reliance or security which constitutes the nature of belief and opinion. The case is the same with the probability of causes as with that of chance. There are some causes which are entirely uniform and constant in producing a particular eect and no instance has ever yet been found of any failure or irregularity in their operation. Fire has always burned and water suocated every human creature The production of motion by impulse and gravity is an universal law which has hitherto admitted of no exception. But there are other causes which have been found more irregular and uncertain nor has rhubarb always proved a purge or opium a soporic to every one who has taken these medicines. It is true when any cause fails of producing its usual eect philosophers ascribe not this to any irregularity in nature but suppose that some secret causes in the particular struc ture of parts have prevented the operation. Our reasonings however and conclusions concerning the event are the same as if this prin ciple had no place. Being determined by custom to transfer the past to the future in all our inferences where the past has been entirely regular and uniform we expect the event with the greatest assurance and leave no room for any contrary supposition. But where dierent eects have been found to follow from causes which are to appear ance exactly similar all these various eects must occur to the mind in transferring the past to the future and enter into our considera tion when we determine the probability of the event. Though we give the preference to that which has been found most usual and believe that this eect will exist we must not overlook the other eects but must assign to each of them a particular weight and author ity in proportion as we have found it to be more or less frequent. It is more probable in almost every country of Europe that there will be frost sometime in January than that the weather will continue open throughout that whole month though this probability varies according to the dierent climates and approaches to a certainty in the more northern kingdoms. Here then it seems evident that when Section VI 42 58 we transfer the past to the future in order to determine the eect which will result from any cause we transfer all the dierent events in the same proportion as they have appeared in the past and conceive one to have existed a hundred times for instance another ten times and another once. As a great number of views do here concur in one event they fortify and conrm it to the imagination beget that sentiment which we call belief and give its object the preference above the contrary event which is not supported by an equal number of experiments and recurs not so frequently to the thought in trans ferring the past to the future. Let any one try to account for this oper ation of the mind upon any of the received systems of philosophy and he will be sensible of the diculty. For my part I shall think it sucient if the present hints excite the curiosity of philosophers and make them sensible how defective all common theories are in treating of such curious and such sublime subjects. Of Probability 43 59 SECTION VII Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion PART I T he great advantage of the mathematical sciences above the moral consists in this that the ideas of the former being sensible are always clear and determinate the smallest distinction between them is immediately perceptible and the same terms are still expressive of the same ideas without ambiguity or variation. An oval is never mistaken for a circle nor an hyperbola for an ellipsis. The isosceles and scalenum are distinguished by boundaries more exact than vice and virtue right and wrong. If any term be dened in geometry the mind readily of itself substitutes on all occasions the denition for the term dened Or even when no denition is employed the object itself may be presented to the senses and by that means be steadily and clearly apprehended. But the ner sentiments of the mind the operations of the understanding the various agitations of the passions though really in themselves distinct easily escape us when surveyed by reflection nor is it in our power to recal the original object as often as we have occasion to contemplate it. Ambiguity by this means is gradually introduced into our reasonings Similar objects are readily taken to be the same And the conclusion becomes at last very wide of the premises. One may safely however arm that if we consider these sciences in a proper light their advantages and disadvantages nearly compensate each other and reduce both of them to a state of equal ity. If the mind with greater facility retains the ideas of geometry clear and determinate it must carry on a much longer and more intricate chain of reasoning and compare ideas much wider of each other in order to reach the abstruser truths of that science. And if moral ideas are apt without extreme care to fall into obscurity and con fusion the inferences are always much shorter in these disquisitions and the intermediate steps which lead to the conclusion much fewer than in the sciences which treat of quantity and number. In reality there is scarcely a proposition in Euclid so simple as not to consist 60 61 of more parts than are to be found in any moral reasoning which runs not into chimera and conceit. Where we trace the principles of the human mind through a few steps we may be very well satised with our progress considering how soon nature throws a bar to all our enquiries concerning causes and reduces us to an acknowledgment of our ignorance. The chief obstacle therefore to our improvement in the moral or metaphysical sciences is the obscurity of the ideas and ambiguity of the terms. The principal diculty in the mathematics is the length of inferences and compass of thought requisite to the forming of any conclusion. And perhaps our progress in natural philosophy is chiey retarded by the want of proper experiments and phaenomena which are often discovered by chance and cannot always be found when requisite even by the most diligent and pru dent enquiry. As moral philosophy seems hitherto to have received less improvement than either geometry or physics we may conclude that if there be any dierence in this respect among these sciences the diculties which obstruct the progress of the former require superior care and capacity to be surmounted. There are no ideas which occur in metaphysics more obscure and uncertain than those of power force energy or necessary connexion of which it is every moment necessary for us to treat in all our disqui sitions. We shall therefore endeavour in this section to x if pos sible the precise meaning of these terms and thereby remove some part of that obscurity which is so much complained of in this species of philosophy. It seems a proposition which will not admit of much dispute that all our ideas are nothing but copies of our impressions or in other words that it is impossible for us to think of any thing which we have not antecedently felt either by our external or internal senses. I have to explain and prove this proposition and have expressed my hopes that by a proper Application of it men may reach a greater clearness and precision in philosophical reasonings than what they have hitherto been able to attain. Complex ideas may perhaps be well known by denition which is nothing but an enumeration of those parts or simple ideas that compose them. But when we have pushed up denitions to the most simple ideas and nd still some ambiguity and obscurity what resource are we Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion 45 62 11 Section II. These impressions are all strong and sensible. They admit not of ambiguity. They are not only placed in a full light themselves but may throw light on their correspondent ideas which lie in obscurity. And by this means we may perhaps attain a new microscope or species of optics by which in the moral sciences the most minute and most simple ideas may be so enlarged as to fall readily under our apprehension and be equally known with the grossest and most sensible ideas that can be the object of our enquiry. To be fully acquainted therefore with the idea of power or necessary connexion let us examine its impression and in order to nd the impression with greater certainty let us Search for it in all the sources from which it may possibly be derived. When we look about us towards external objects and consider the operation of causes we are never able in a single instance to dis cover any power or necessary connexion any quality which binds the eect to the cause and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other. We only nd that the one does actually in fact follow the other. The impulse of one billiardball is attended with motion in the second. This is the whole that appears to the outward senses. The mind feels no sentiment or inward impression from this succession of objects Consequently there is not in any single particular instance of cause and eect any thing which can suggest the idea of power or necessary connexion. From the rst appearance of an object we never can conjecture what eect will result from it. But were the power or energy of any cause discoverable by the mind we could foresee the eect even without experience and might at rst pronounce with certainty concerning it by the mere dint of thought and reasoning. In reality there is no part of matter that does ever by its sen sible qualities discover any power or energy or give us ground to imagine that it could produce any thing or be followed by any other object which we could denominate its eect. Solidity extension motion these qualities are all complete in themselves and never point out any other event which may result from them. The scenes of the universe are continually shifting and one object follows another in an uninterrupted succession but the power or force which actuates Section VII 46 63 the whole machine is entirely concealed from us and never discovers itself in any of the sensible qualities of body. We know that in fact heat is a constant attendant of ame but what is the connexion between them we have no room so much as to conjecture or imagine. It is impossible therefore that the idea of power can be derived from the contemplation of bodies in single instances of their operation because no bodies ever discover any power which can be the original of thi. Since therefore external objects as they appear to the senses give us no idea of power or necessary connexion by their operation in particular instances let us see whether this idea be derived from reection on the operations of our own minds and be copied from any internal impression. It may be said that we are every moment conscious of internal power while we feel that by the simple command of our will we can move the organs of our body or direct the faculties of our mind. An act of volition produces motion in our limbs or raises a new idea in our imagination. This inuence of the will we know by consciousness. Hence we acquire the idea of power or energy and are certain that we ourselves and all other intelligent beings are possessed of power. This idea then is an idea of reection since it arises from reecting on the operations of our own mind and on the command which is exercised by will both over the organs of the body and faculties of the soul. We shall proceed to examine this pretension and rst with regard to the inuence of volition over the organs of the body. This inuence we may observe is a fact which like all other natural events can be known only by experience and can never be foreseen from any apparent energy or power in the cause which connects it with the eect and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other. The motion of our body follows upon the command of our will. Of this we are every moment conscious. But the means by which this is eected the energy by which the will performs so extraordinary an operation of this we are so far from being immediately conscious that it must for ever escape our most diligent enquiry. Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion 47 64 65 12 Mr. Locke in his chapter of power says that nding from experience that there are several new productions in matter and concluding that there must somewhere be a power capable of producing them we arrive at last by this reasoning at the idea of power. But no reasoning can ever give us a new original simple idea as this philosopher himself confesses. This therefore can never be the origin of that idea. For rst is there any principle in all nature more mysterious than the union of soul with body by which a supposed spiritual substance acquires such an inuence over a material one that the most rened thought is able to actuate the grossest matter Were we empow ered by a secret wish to remove mountains or control the planets in their orbit this extensive authority would not be more extraordinary nor more beyond our comprehension. But if by consciousness we perceived any power or energy in the will we must know this power we must know its connexion with the eect we must know the secret union of soul and body and the nature of both these substances by which the one is able to operate in so many instances upon the other. Secondly We are not able to move all the organs of the body with a like authority though we cannot assign any reason besides experience for so remarkable a dierence between one and the other. Why has the will an inuence over the tongue and ngers not over the heart or liver This question would never embarrass us were we conscious of a power in the former case not in the latter. We should then perceive independent of experience why the authority of will over the organs of the body is circumscribed within such particular limits. Being in that case fully acquainted with the power or force by which it operates we should also know why its inuence reaches precisely to such boundaries and no farther. A man suddenly struck with a palsy in the leg or arm or who had newly lost those members frequently endeavours at rst to move them and employ them in their usual oces. Here he is as much conscious of power to command such limbs as a man in perfect health is conscious of power to actuate any member which remains in its natural state and condition. But consciousness never deceives. Consequently neither in the one case nor in the other are we ever conscious of any power. We learn the inuence of our will from experience alone. And experience only teaches us how one event constantly follows another without instructing us in the secret connexion which binds them together and renders them inseparable. Thirdly We learn from anatomy that the immediate object of power in voluntary motion is not the member itself which is moved but certain muscles and nerves and animal spirits and perhaps something still more minute and more unknown through which the motion is successively propagated ere it reach the member itself whose motion is the immediate object of volition. Can there be Section VII 48 66 a more certain proof that the power by which this whole operation is performed so far from being directly and fully known by an inward sentiment or consciousness is to the last degree mysterious and unintelligible Here the mind wills a certain event Immediately another event unknown to ourselves and totally dierent from the one intended is produced This event produces another equally unknown Till at last through a long succession the desired event is produced. But if the original power were felt it must be known Were it known its eect must also be known since all power is relative to its eect. And vice versa if the eect be not known the power cannot be known nor felt. How indeed can we be conscious of a power to move our limbs when we have no such power but only that to move certain animal spirits which though they produce at last the motion of our limbs yet operate in such a manner as is wholly beyond our comprehension We may therefore conclude from the whole I hope without any temerity though with assurance that our idea of power is not copied from any sentiment or consciousness of power within ourselves when we give rise to animal motion or apply our limbs to their proper use and oce. That their motion follows the command of the will is a matter of common experience like other natural events But the power or energy by which this is eected like that in other natural events is unknown an. Shall we then assert that we are conscious of a power or energy in our own minds when by an act or command of our will we raise up a new idea x the mind to the contemplation of it turn it on all sides and at last dismiss it for some other idea when we think that we have surveyed it with sucient accuracy I believe the same arguments will prove that even this command of the will gives us no real idea of force or energy. First It must be allowed that when we know a power we know that very circumstance in the cause by which it is enabled to produce the eect For these are supposed to be synonimous. We must therefore know both the cause and eect and the relation between them. But do we pretend to be acquainted with the nature of the human soul and the nature of an idea or the aptitude of the one to produce the other This is a real creation a production of Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion 49 67 68 13 See endnote p. At least it must be owned that such a power is not felt nor known nor even conceivable by the mind. We only feel the event namely the existence of an idea consequent to a command of the will But the manner in which this operation is performed the power by which it is produced is entirely beyond our comprehension. Secondly The command of the mind over itself is limited as well as its command over the body and these limits are not known by reason or any acquaintance with the nature of cause and eect but only by experience and observation as in all other natural events and in the operation of external objects. Our authority over our sentiments and passions is much weaker than that over our ideas and even the latter authority is circumscribed within very narrow boundaries. Will any one pretend to assign the ultimate reason of these boundaries or show why the power is decient in one case not in another. Thirdly This selfcommand is very dierent at dierent times. A man in health possesses more of it than one languishing with sickness. We are more master of our thoughts in the morning than in the evening Fasting than after a full meal. Can we give any reason for these variations except experience Where then is the power of which we pretend to be conscious Is there not here either in a spiritual or material substance or both some secret mechanism or structure of parts upon which the eect depends and which being entirely unknown to us renders the power or energy of the will equally unknown and incomprehensible Volition is surely an act of the mind with which we are suciently acquainted. Reect upon it. Consider it on all sides. Do you nd any thing in it like this creative power by which it raises from nothing a new idea and with a kind of Fiat imitates the omnipotence of its Maker if I may be allowed so to speak who called forth into existence all the various scenes of nature So far from being conscious of this energy in the will it requires as certain expe rience as that of which we are possessed to convince us that such extraordinary eects do ever result from a simple act of volition. The generality of mankind never nd any diculty in account ing for the more common and familiar operations of nature such as the descent of heavy bodies the growth of plants the generation of animals or the nourishment of bodies by food But suppose that in Section VII 50 69 all these cases they perceive the very force or energy of the cause by which it is connected with its eect and is for ever infallible in its oper ation. They acquire by long habit such a turn of mind that upon the appearance of the cause they immediately expect with assurance its usual attendant and hardly conceive it possible that any other event could result from it. It is only on the discovery of extraordinary phaenomena such as earthquakes pestilence and prodigies of any kind that they nd themselves at a loss to assign a proper cause and to explain the manner in which the eect is produced by it. It is usual for men in such diculties to have recourse to some invisible intelligent as the immediate cause of that event which surprises them and which they think cannot be accounted for from the common powers of nature. But philosophers who carry their scrutiny a little farther immediately perceive that even in the most familiar events the energy of the cause is as unintelligible as in the most unusual and that we only learn by experience the frequent Conjunction of objects without being ever able to comprehend any thing like Connexion between them. Here then many philoso phers think themselves obliged by reason to have recourse on all occasions to the same principle which the vulgar never appeal to but in cases that appear miraculous and supernatural. They acknow ledge mind and intelligence to be not only the ultimate and original cause of all things but the immediate and sole cause of every event which appears in nature. They pretend that those objects which are commonly denominated causes are in reality nothing but occasions and that the true and direct principle of every eect is not any power or force in nature but a volition of the Supreme Being who wills that such particular objects should for ever be conjoined with each other. Instead of saying that one billiardball moves another by a force which it has derived from the author of nature it is the Deity himself they say who by a particular volition moves the second ball being determined to this operation by the impulse of the rst ball in consequence of those general laws which he has laid down to himself in the government of the universe. But philosophers advanc ing still in their enquiries discover that as we are totally ignorant of the power on which depends the mutual operation of bodies we are no less ignorant of that power on which depends the operation of Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion 51 70 14 . The same ignorance therefore reduces them to the same conclusion. They assert that the Deity is the immediate cause of the union between soul and body and that they are not the organs of sense which being agitated by external objects produce sensations in the mind but that it is a particular volition of our omnipotent Maker which excites such a sensation in consequence of such a motion in the organ. In like manner it is not any energy in the will that produces local motion in our members It is God himself who is pleased to second our will in itself impotent and to command that motion which we erroneously attribute to our own power and ecacy. Nor do philosophers stop at this conclusion. They sometimes extend the same inference to the mind itself in its internal operations. Our mental vision or conception of ideas is nothing but a revelation made to us by our Maker. When we voluntarily turn our thoughts to any object and raise up its image in the fancy it is not the will which creates that idea It is the universal Creator who discovers it to the mind and renders it present to us. Thus according to these philosophers every thing is full of God. Not content with the principle that nothing exists but by his will that nothing possesses any power but by his concession They rob nature and all created beings of every power in order to render their dependence on the Deity still more sensible and immediate. They consider not that by this theory they diminish instead of magnifying the grandeur of those attributes which they aect so much to celebrate. It argues surely more power in the Deity to dele gate a certain degree of power to inferior creatures than to produce every thing by his own immediate volition. It argues more wisdom to contrive at rst the fabric of the world with such perfect foresight that of itself and by its proper operation it may serve all the pur poses of providence than if the great Creator were obliged every moment to adjust its parts and animate by his breath all the wheels of that stupendous machine. But if we would have a more philosophical confutation of this theory perhaps the two following reections may suce. First It seems to me that this theory of the universal energy and operation of the Supreme Being is too bold ever to carry convic tion with it to a man suciently apprized of the weakness of human Section VII 52 71 72 reason and the narrow limits to which it is conned in all its opera tions. Though the chain of arguments which conduct to it were ever so logical there must arise a strong suspicion if not an absolute assurance that it has carried us quite beyond the reach of our faculties when it leads to conclusions so extraordinary and so remote from common life and experience. We are got into fairy land long ere we have reached the last steps of our theory and there we have no reason to trust our common methods of argument or to think that our usual analogies and probabilities have any authority. Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses. And however we may atter ourselves that we are guided in every step which we take by a kind of verisimili tude and experience we may be assured that this fancied experience has no authority when we thus apply it to subjects that lie entirely out of the sphere of experience. But on this we shall have occasion to touc. Secondly I cannot perceive any force in the arguments on which this theory is founded. We are ignorant it is true of the manner in which bodies operate on each other Their force or energy is entirely incomprehensible But are we not equally ignorant of the manner or force by which a mind even the supreme mind operates either on itself or on body Whence I beseech you do we acquire any idea of it We have no sentiment or consciousness of this power in ourselves. We have no idea of the Supreme Being but what we learn from reection on our own faculties. Were our ignorance therefore a good reason for rejecting any thing we should be led into that principle of denying all energy in the Supreme Being as much as in the grossest matter. We surely com prehend as little the operations of one as of the other. Is it more dicult to conceive that motion may arise from impulse than that it may arise from volition All we know is our profound ignorance in both cases 16. PART II But to hasten to a conclusion of this argument which is already drawn out to too great a length We have sought in vain for an idea of power or necessary connexion in all the sources from which we could suppose it to be derived. It appears that in single instances of Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion 53 73 15 Section XII. 6 See endnote p. The same diculty occurs in contemplating the operations of mind on body where we observe the motion of the latter to follow upon the volition of the former but are not able to observe or conceive the tye which binds together the motion and volition or the energy by which the mind produces this eect. The authority of the will over its own faculties and ideas is not a whit more comprehensible So that upon the whole there appears not throughout all nature any one instance of connexion which is conceivable by us. All events seem entirely loose and separate. One event follows another but we never can observe any tye between them. They seem conjoined but never connected. And as we can have no idea of any thing which never appeared to our outward sense or inward sentiment the necessary conclusion seems to be that we have no idea of connexion or power at all and that these words are absolutely without any meaning when employed either in philosophical reasonings or common life. But there still remains one method of avoiding this conclusion and one source which we have not yet examined. When any natural object or event is presented it is impossible for us by any sagacity or penetration to discover or even conjecture without experience what event will result from it or to carry our foresight beyond that object which is immediately present to the memory and senses. Even after one instance or experiment where we have observed a particular event to follow upon another we are not entitled to form a general rule or fore tel what will happen in like cases it being justly esteemed an unpardon able temerity to judge of the whole course of nature from one single experiment however accurate or certain. But when one particular species of event has always in all instances been conjoined with another we make no longer any scruple of foretelling one upon the appearance of the other and of employing that reasoning which can alone assure us of any matter of fact or existence. We then call the one object Cause the other Eect. We suppose that there is some connexion between them some power in the one by which it infallibly produces the other and operates with the greatest certainty and strongest necessity. It appears then that this idea of a necessary connexion among events arises from a number of similar instances which occur Section VII 54 74 75 of the constant conjunction of these events nor can that idea ever be suggested by any one of these instances surveyed in all possible lights and positions. But there is nothing in a number of instances dierent from every single instance which is supposed to be exactly similar except only that after a repetition of similar instances the mind is carried by habit upon the appearance of one event to expect its usual attendant and to believe that it will exist. This connexion therefore which we feel in the mind this customary transition of the imagination from one object to its usual attendant is the sentiment or impression from which we form the idea of power or necessary connexion. Nothing farther is in the case. Contemplate the subject on all sides you will never nd any other origin of that idea. This is the sole dierence between one instance from which we can never receive the idea of connexion and a number of similar instances by which it is suggested. The rst time a man saw the communication of motion by impulse as by the shock of two billiardballs he could not pronounce that the one event was connected but only that it was conjoined with the other. After he has observed several instances of this nature he then pronounces them to be connected. What alteration has happened to give rise to this new idea of connexion Nothing but that he now feels these events to be connected in his imagination and can readily foretel the existence of one from the appearance of the other. When we say therefore that one object is connected with another we mean only that they have acquired a connexion in our thought and give rise to this inference by which they become proofs of each others existence a conclusion which is somewhat extraordinary but which seems founded on sucient evidence. Nor will its evidence be weakened by any general didence of the understanding or sceptical suspicion concerning every conclusion which is new and extraordi nary. No conclusions can be more agreeable to scepticism than such as make discoveries concerning the weakness and narrow limits of human reason and capacity. And what stronger instance can be produced of the surpris ing ignorance and weakness of the understanding than the present For surely if there be any relation among objects which it imports to us to know perfectly it is that of cause and eect. On this are founded all our reasonings concerning matter of fact or existence. By means of it alone we attain any assurance concerning objects which are removed from the present testimony of our memory and senses. Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion 55 76 The only immediate utility of all sciences is to teach us how to con trol and regulate future events by their causes. Our thoughts and enquiries are therefore every moment employed about this rela tion Yet so imperfect are the ideas which we form concerning it that it is impossible to give any just denition of cause except what is drawn from something extraneous and foreign to it. Similar objects are always conjoined with similar. Of this we have experience. Suitably to this experience therefore we may dene a cause to be an object followed by another and where all the objects similar to the rst are followed by objects similar to the second. Or in other words where if the rst object had not been the second never had existed. The appearance of a cause always conveys the mind by a customary tran sition to the idea of the eect. Of this also we have experience. We may therefore suitably to this experience form another denition of cause and call it an object followed by another and whose appear ance always conveys the thought to that other. But though both these denitions be drawn from circumstances foreign to the cause we cannot remedy this inconvenience or attain any more perfect denition which may point out that circumstance in the cause which gives it a connexion with its eect. We have no idea of this connexion nor even any distinct notion what it is we desire to know when we endeavour at a conception of it. We say for instance that the vibration of this string is the cause of this particular sound. But what do we mean by that armation We either mean that this vibra tion is followed by this sound and that all similar vibrations have been fol lowed by similar sounds Or that this vibration is followed by this sound and that upon the appearance of one the mind anticipates the senses and forms immediately an idea of the other. We may consider the relation of cause and eect in either of these two lights but beyond these we have no idea of it 17. To recapitulate therefore the reasonings of this section Every idea is copied from some preceding impression or sentiment and where we cannot nd any impression we may be certain that there is no idea. In all single instances of the operation of bodies or minds there is nothing that produces any impression nor consequently can suggest any idea of power or necessary connexion. But when many uniform instances appear and the same object is always followed by Section VII 56 77 78 17 See endnote p. We then feel a new sentiment or impression to wit a cus tomary connexion in the thought or imagination between one object and its usual attendant and this sentiment is the original of that idea which we seek for. For as this idea arises from a number of similar instances and not from any single instance it must arise from that circumstance in which the number of instances dier from every individual instance. But this customary connexion or transition of the imagination is the only circumstance in which they dier. In every other particular they are alike. The rst instance which we saw of motion communicated by the shock of two billiardballs to return to this obvious illustration is exactly similar to any instance that may at present occur to us except only that we could not at rst infer one event from the other which we are enabled to do at present after so long a course of uniform experience. I know not whether the reader will readily apprehend this reasoning. I am afraid that should I multiply words about it or throw it into a greater variety of lights it would only become more obscure and intricate. In all abstract reason ings there is one point of view which if we can happily hit we shall go farther towards illustrating the subject than by all the eloquence and copious expression in the world. This point of view we should endeav our to reach and reserve the owers of rhetoric for subjects which are more adapted to them. Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion 57 79 SECTION VIII Of Liberty and Necessity PART I I t might reasonably be expected in questions which have been canvassed and disputed with great eagerness since the rst origin of science and philosophy that the meaning of all the terms at least should have been agreed upon among the disputants and our enquiries in the course of two thousand years been able to pass from words to the true and real subject of the controversy. For how easy may it seem to give exact denitions of the terms employed in reasoning and make these denitions not the mere sound of words the object of future scrutiny and examination But if we consider the matter more narrowly we shall be apt to draw a quite opposite conclusion. From this circumstance alone that a controversy has been long kept on foot and remains still undecided we may presume that there is some ambiguity in the expression and that the disputants ax dierent ideas to the terms employed in the controversy. For as the faculties of the mind are supposed to be naturally alike in every individual otherwise nothing could be more fruitless than to reason or dispute together it were impossible if men ax the same ideas to their terms that they could so long form dierent opinions of the same subject especially when they communicate their views and each party turn themselves on all sides in Search of arguments which may give them the victory over their antagonists. It is true if men attempt the discussion of questions which lie entirely beyond the reach of human capacity such as those concerning the origin of worlds or the oeconomy of the intellectual system or region of spirits they may long beat the air in their fruitless contests and never arrive at any determinate conclusion. But if the question regard any subject of common life and experience nothing one would think could preserve the dispute so long undecided but some ambiguous expressions which keep the antagonists still at a distance and hinder them from grappling with each other. This has been the case in the long disputed question concerning liberty and necessity and to so remarkable a degree that if I be not 80 81 much mistaken we shall nd that all mankind both learned and ignorant have always been of the same opinion with regard to this subject and that a few intelligible denitions would immediately have put an end to the whole controversy. I own that this dispute has been so much canvassed on all hands and has led philosophers into such a labyrinth of obscure sophistry that it is no wonder if a sens ible reader indulge his ease so far as to turn a deaf ear to the proposal of such a question from which he can expect neither instruction nor entertainment. But the state of the argument here proposed may perhaps serve to renew his attention as it has more novelty promises at least some decision of the controversy and will not much disturb his ease by any intricate or obscure reasoning. I hope therefore to make it appear that all men have ever agreed in the doctrine both of necessity and of liberty according to any reasonable sense which can be put on these terms and that the whole controversy has hitherto turned merely upon words. We shall begin with examining the doctrine of necessity. It is universally allowed that matter in all its operations is actuated by a necessary force and that every natural eect is so pre cisely determined by the energy of its cause that no other eect in such particular circumstances could possibly have resulted from it. The degree and direction of every motion is by the laws of nature prescribed with such exactness that a living creature may as soon arise from the shock of two bodies as motion in any other degree or direction than what is actually produced by it. Would we therefore form a just and precise idea of necessity we must consider whence that idea arises when we apply it to the operation of bodies. It seems evident that if all the scenes of nature were continually shifted in such a manner that no two events bore any resemblance to each other but every object was entirely new without any similitude to whatever had been seen before we should never in that case have attained the least idea of necessity or of a connexion among these objects. We might say upon such a supposition that one object or event has followed another not that one was produced by the other. The relation of cause and eect must be utterly unknown to mankind. Inference and reasoning concerning the operations of nature would from that moment be at an end and the memory and senses remain the only canals by which the knowledge of any real existence could possibly have access to the mind. Our idea therefore of necessity and Of Liberty and Necessity 59 82 causation arises entirely from the uniformity observable in the oper ations of nature where similar objects are constantly conjoined together and the mind is determined by custom to infer the one from the appearance of the other. These two circumstances form the whole of that necessity which we ascribe to matter. Beyond the constant conjunction of similar objects and the consequent inference from one to the other we have no notion of any necessity or connexion. If it appear therefore that all mankind have ever allowed without any doubt or hesitation that these two circumstances take place in the voluntary actions of men and in the operations of mind it must follow that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of necessity and that they have hitherto disputed merely for not understanding each other. As to the rst circumstance the constant and regular conjunc tion of similar events we may possibly satisfy ourselves by the following considerations. It is universally acknowledged that there is a great uniformity among the actions of men in all nations and ages and that human nature remains still the same in its principles and operations. The same motives always produce the same actions The same events follow from the same causes. Ambition avarice selflove vanity friendship generosity public spirit these passions mixed in various degrees and distributed through society have been from the beginning of the world and still are the source of all the actions and enterprizes which have ever been observed among mankind. Would you know the sentiments inclinations and course of life of the Greeks and Romans Study well the temper and actions of the French and English You cannot be much mistaken in transferring to the former most of the observations which you have made with regard to the latter. Mankind are so much the same in all times and places that history informs us of nothing new or strange in this particular. Its chief use is only to discover the constant and universal principles of human nature by shewing men in all varieties of cir cumstances and situations and furnishing us with materials from which we may form our observations and become acquainted with the regular springs of human action and behaviour. These records of wars intrigues factions and revolutions are so many collections of experiments by which the politician or moral philosopher xes the principles of his science in the same manner as the physician or natural philosopher becomes acquainted with the nature of plants Section VIII 60 83 84 minerals and other external objects by the experiments which he forms concerning them. Nor are the earth water and other elements examined by Aristotle and Hippocrates more like to those which at present lie under our observation than the men described by Polybius and Tacitus are to those who now govern the world. Should a traveller returning from a far country bring us an account of men wholly dierent from any with whom we were ever acquainted men who were entirely divested of avarice ambition or revenge who knew no pleasure but friendship generosity and public spirit we should immediately from these circumstances detect the falsehood and prove him a liar with the same certainty as if he had stued his narration with stories of centaurs and dragons miracles and prodigies. And if we would explode any forgery in history we cannot make use of a more convincing argument than to prove that the actions ascribed to any person are directly contrary to the course of nature and that no human motives in such circumstances could ever induce him to such a conduct. The veracity of Quintus Curtius is as much to be suspected when he describes the supernatural courage of Alexander by which he was hurried on singly to attack multitudes as when he describes his supernatural force and activity by which he was able to resist them. So readily and universally do we acknowledge a uniformity in human motives and actions as well as in the operations of body. Hence likewise the benet of that experience acquired by long life and a variety of business and company in order to instruct us in the principles of human nature and regulate our future conduct as well as speculation. By means of this guide we mount up to the knowledge of mens inclinations and motives from their actions expressions and even gestures and again descend to the interpretation of their actions from our knowledge of their motives and inclinations. The general observations treasured up by a course of experience give us the clue of human nature and teach us to unravel all its intricacies. Pretexts and appearances no longer deceive us. Public declarations pass for the specious colouring of a cause. And though virtue and honour be allowed their proper weight and authority that perfect dis interestedness so often pretended to is never expected in multitudes and parties seldom in their leaders and scarcely even in individuals of any rank or station. But were there no uniformity in human actions and were every experiment which we could form of this Of Liberty and Necessity 61 85 kind irregular and anomalous it were impossible to collect any gen eral observations concerning mankind and no experience however accurately digested by reection would ever serve to any purpose. Why is the aged husbandman more skilful in his calling than the young beginner but because there is a certain uniformity in the oper ation of the sun rain and earth towards the production of vegetables and experience teaches the old practitioner the rules by which this operation is governed and directed We must not however expect that this uniformity of human actions should be carried to such a length as that all men in the same circumstances will always act precisely in the same manner without making any allowance for the diversity of characters prejudices and opinions. Such a uniformity in every particular is found in no part of nature. On the contrary from observing the variety of conduct in dierent men we are enabled to form a greater variety of maxims which still suppose a degree of uniformity and regularity. Are the manners of men dierent in dierent ages and coun tries We learn thence the great force of custom and education which mould the human mind from its infancy and form it into a xed and established character. Is the behaviour and conduct of the one sex very unlike that of the other It is thence we become acquainted with the dierent characters which nature has impressed upon the sexes and which she preserves with constancy and regularity. Are the actions of the same person much diversied in the dierent periods of his life from infancy to old age This aords room for many general observa tions concerning the gradual change of our sentiments and inclinations and the dierent maxims which prevail in the dierent ages of human creatures. Even the characters which are peculiar to each individual have a uniformity in their inuence otherwise our acquaintance with the persons and our observation of their conduct could never teach us their dispositions or serve to direct our behaviour with regard to them. I grant it possible to nd some actions which seem to have no regular connexion with any known motives and are exceptions to all the measures of conduct which have ever been established for the government of men. But if we would willingly know what judgment should be formed of such irregular and extraordinary actions we may consider the sentiments commonly entertained with regard to those irregular events which appear in the course of nature and the operations of external objects. All causes are not conjoined to their Section VIII 62 86 usual eects with like uniformity. An articer who handles only dead matter may be disappointed of his aim as well as the politician who directs the conduct of sensible and intelligent agents. The vulgar who take things according to their rst appear anceattribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the causes as makes the latter often fail of their usual inuence though they meet with no impediment in their operation. But philosophers observing that almost in every part of nature there is contained a vast variety of springs and principles which are hid by reason of their minuteness or remoteness nd that it is at least possible the contrari ety of events may not proceed from any contingency in the cause but from the secret operation of contrary causes. This possibility is converted into certainty by farther observation when they remark that upon an exact scrutiny a contrariety of eects always betrays a contrariety of causes and proceeds from their mutual opposition. A peasant can give no better reason for the stopping of any clock or watch than to say that it does not commonly go right But an artist easily perceives that the same force in the spring or pendulum has always the same inuence on the wheels but fails of its usual eect perhaps by reason of a grain of dust which puts a stop to the whole movement. From the observation of several parallel instances philoso phers form a maxim that the connexion between all causes and eects is equally necessary and that its seeming uncertainty in some instances proceeds from the secret opposition of contrary causes. Thus for instance in the human body when the usual symp toms of health or sickness disappoint our expectation when medi cines operate not with their wonted powers when irregular events follow from any particular cause the philosopher and physician are not surprized at the matter nor are ever tempted to deny in general the necessity and uniformity of those principles by which the animal oeconomy is conducted. They know that a human body is a mighty complicated machine That many secret powers lurk in it which are altogether beyond our comprehension That to us it must often appear very uncertain in its operations And that therefore the irregular events which outwardly discover themselves can be no proof that the laws of nature are not observed with the greatest regularity in its internal operations and government. The philosopher if he be consistent must apply the same reasoning to the actions and volitions of intelligent agents. The most Of Liberty and Necessity 63 87 88 irregular and unexpected resolutions of men may frequently be accounted for by those who know every particular circumstance of their character and situation. A person of an obliging disposition gives a peevish answer But he has the toothake or has not dined. A stupid fellow discovers an uncommon alacrity in his carriage But he has met with a sudden piece of good fortune. Or even when an action as some times happens cannot be particularly accounted for either by the person himself or by others we know in general that the characters of men are to a certain degree inconstant and irregular. This is in a manner the constant character of human nature though it be applic able in a more particular manner to some persons who have no xed rule for their conduct but proceed in a continued course of caprice and inconstancy. The internal principles and motives may operate in a uniform manner notwithstanding these seeming irregularities in the same manner as the winds rain clouds and other variations of the weather are supposed to be governed by steady principles though not easily discoverable by human sagacity and enquiry. Thus it appears not only that the conjunction between motives and voluntary actions is as regular and uniform as that between the cause and eect in any part of nature but also that this regular conjunction has been universally acknowledged among mankind and has never been the subject of dispute either in philosophy or common life. Now as it is from past experience that we draw all inferences concerning the future and as we conclude that objects will always be conjoined together which we nd to have always been conjoined it may seem superuous to prove that this experienced uniformity in human actions is a source whence we draw inferences concerning them. But in order to throw the argument into a greater variety of lights we shall also insist though briey on this latter topic. The mutual dependence of men is so great in all societies that scarce any human action is entirely compleat in itself or is performed without some reference to the actions of others which are requisite to make it answer fully the intention of the agent. The poorest articer who labours alone expects at least the protection of the magistrate to ensure him the enjoyment of the fruits of his labour. He also expects that when he carries his goods to market and oers them at a reasonable price he shall nd purchasers and shall be able by the money he acquires to engage others to supply him with those commodities which are requisite for his subsistence. In proportion Section VIII 64 89 as men extend their dealings and render their intercourse with others more complicated they always comprehend in their schemes of life a greater variety of voluntary actions which they expect from the proper motives to cooperate with their own. In all these conclu sions they take their measures from past experience in the same manner as in their reasonings concerning external objects and rmly believe that men as well as all the elements are to continue in their operations the same that they have ever found them. A manufac turer reckons upon the labour of his servants for the execution of any work as much as upon the tools which he employs and would be equally surprized were his expectations disappointed. In short this experimental inference and reasoning concerning the actions of others enters so much into human life that no man while awake is ever a moment without employing it. Have we not reason therefore to arm that all mankind have always agreed in the doctrine of necessity according to the foregoing denition and explication of it Nor have philosophers ever entertained a dierent opinion from the people in this particular. For not to mention that almost every action of their life supposes that opinion there are even few of the speculative parts of learning to which it is not essential. What would become of history had we not a dependence on the veracity of the historian according to the experience which we have had of mankind How could politics be a science if laws and forms of government had not a uniform inuence upon society Where would be the foundation of morals if particular characters had no certain or determinate power to produce particular sentiments and if these sentiments had no constant operation on actions And with what pretence could we employ our criticism upon any poet or polite author if we could not pronounce the conduct and sentiments of his actors either natural or unnatural to such characters and in such circumstances It seems almost impossible therefore to engage either in science or action of any kind without acknowledging the doctrine of necessity and this inference from motives to voluntary actions from characters to conduct. And indeed when we consider how aptly natural and moral evidence link together and form only one chain of argument we shall make no scruple to allow that they are of the same nature and derived from the same principles. A prisoner who has neither money nor interest discovers the impossibility of his escape as well when Of Liberty and Necessity 65 90 he considers the obstinacy of the gaoler as the walls and bars with which he is surrounded and in all attempts for his freedom chuses rather to work upon the stone and iron of the one than upon the inexible nature of the other. The same prisoner when conducted to the scaold foresees his death as certainly from the constancy and delity of his guards as from the operation of the ax or wheel. His mind runs along a certain train of ideas The refusal of the soldiers to consent to his escape the action of the executioner the separation of the head and body bleeding convulsive motions and death. Here is a connected chain of natural causes and voluntary actions but the mind feels no dierence between them in passing from one link to another Nor is less certain of the future event than if it were connected with the objects present to the memory or senses by a train of causes cemented together by what we are pleased to call a physical necessity. The same experienced union has the same eect on the mind whether the united objects be motives volition and actions or gure and motion. We may change the names of things but their nature and their operation on the understanding never change. Were a man whom I know to be honest and opulent and with whom I live in intimate friendship to come into my house where I am surrounded with my servants I rest assured that he is not to stab me before he leaves it in order to rob me of my silver standish and I no more suspect this event than the falling of the house itself which is new and solidly built and founded.But he may have been seized with a sudden and unknown frenzy.So may a sudden earthquake arise and shake and tumble my house about my ears. I shall therefore change the suppositions. I shall say that I know with certainty that he is not to put his hand into the re and hold it there till it be consumed And this event I think I can foretell with the same assurance as that if he throw himself out at the window and meet with no obstruction he will not remain a moment suspended in the air. No suspicion of an unknown frenzy can give the least possibility to the former event which is so con trary to all the known principles of human nature. A man who at noon leaves his purse full of gold on the pavement at CharingCross may as well expect that it will y away like a feather as that he will nd it untouched an hour after. Above one half of human reasonings contain inferences of a similar nature attended with more or less degrees of certainty proportioned to our experience of the usual conduct of mankind in such particular situations. Section VIII 66 91 I have frequently considered what could possibly be the reason why all mankind though they have ever without hesitation acknowledged the doctrine of necessity in their whole practice and reasoning have yet discovered such a reluctance to acknowledge it in words and have rather shewn a propensity in all ages to profess the contrary opinion. The matter I think may be accounted for after the following manner. If we examine the operations of body and the production of eects from their causes we shall nd that all our faculties can never carry us farther in our knowledge of this relation than barely to observe that particular objects are constantly conjoined together and that the mind is carried by a customary transition from the appearance of one to the belief of the other. But though this conclusion concerning human ignorance be the result of the strictest scrutiny of this subject men still entertain a strong propensity to believe that they penetrate farther into the powers of nature and perceive something like a necessary connexion between the cause and the eect. When again they turn their reections towards the opera tions of their own minds and feel no such connexion of the motive and the action they are thence apt to suppose that there is a dierence between the eects which result from material force and those which arise from thought and intelligence. But being once convinced that we know nothing farther of causation of any kind than merely the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of the mind from one to another and nding that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have place in voluntary actions we may be more easily led to own the same necessity common to all causes. And though this reasoning may contradict the systems of many philosophers in ascribing necessity to the determinations of the will we shall nd upon reection that they dissent from it in words only not in their real sentiment. Necessity according to the sense in which it is here taken has never yet been rejected nor can ever I think be rejected by any philosopher. It may only perhaps be pretended that the mind can perceive in the operations of matter some farther connexion between the cause and eect and a connexion that has not place in the voluntary actions of intelligent beings. Now whether it be so or not can only appear upon examination and it is incumbent on these philosophers to make good their assertion by dening or describing that necessity and pointing it out to us in the operations of material causes. Of Liberty and Necessity 67 92 93 It would seem indeed that men begin at the wrong end of this question concerning liberty and necessity when they enter upon it by examining the faculties of the soul the inuence of the under standing and the operations of the will. Let them rst discuss a more simple question namely the operations of body and of brute unin telligent matter and try whether they can there form any idea of causation and necessity except that of a constant conjunction of objects and subsequent inference of the mind from one to another. If these circumstances form in reality the whole of that necessity which we conceive in matter and if these circumstances be also uni versally acknowledged to take place in the operations of the mind the dispute is at an end at least must be owned to be thenceforth merely verbal. But as long as we will rashly suppose that we have some farther idea of necessity and causation in the operations of external objects at the same time that we can nd nothing farther in the voluntary actions of the mind there is no possibility of bring ing the question to any determinate issue while we proceed upon so erroneous a supposition. The only method of undeceiving us is to mount up higher to examine the narrow extent of science when applied to material causes and to convince ourselves that all we know of them is the constant conjunction and inference above men tioned. We may perhaps nd that it is with diculty we are induced to x such narrow limits to human understanding But we can after wards nd no diculty when we come to apply this doctrine to the actions of the will. For as it is evident that these have a regular con junction with motives and circumstances and characters and as we always draw inferences from one to the other we must be obliged to acknowledge in words that necessity which we have already avowed in every deliberation of our lives and in every step of our conduct an. But to proceed in this reconciling project with regard to the question of liberty and necessity the most contentious question of metaphysics the most contentious science it will not require many words to prove that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of liberty as well as in that of necessity and that the whole dispute in this respect also has been hitherto merely verbal. For what is meant by liberty when applied to voluntary actions We cannot surely mean Section VIII 68 94 95 18 See endnote p. For these are plain and acknowledged matters of fact. By liberty then we can only mean a power of acting or not acting according to the determinations of the will that is if we chuse to remain at rest we may if we chuse to move we also may. Now this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains. Here then is no sub ject of dispute. Whatever denition we may give of liberty we should be careful to observe two requisite circumstances rst that it be consis tent with plain matter of fact secondly that it be consistent with itself. If we observe these circumstances and render our denition intelligible I am persuaded that all mankind will be found of one opinion with regard to it. It is universally allowed that nothing exists without a cause of its existence and that chance when strictly examined is a mere negative word and means not any real power which has any where a being in nature. But it is pretended that some causes are necessary some not necessary. Here then is the advantage of denitions. Let any one dene a cause without comprehending as a part of the denition a necessary connexion with its eect and let him shew distinctly the origin of the idea expressed by the denition and I shall readily give up the whole controversy. But if the foregoing explication of the matter be received this must be absolutely impracticable. Had not objects a regular conjunction with each other we should never have entertained any notion of cause and eect and this regular conjunction produces that inference of the understanding which is the only con nexion that we can have any comprehension of. Whoever attempts a denition of cause exclusive of these circumstances will be obliged either to employ unintelligible terms or such as are synonimous to the term which he endeavours to dene19. And if the denition above mentioned be admitted liberty when opposed to necessity not to constraint is the same thing with chance which is universally allowed to have no existence. Of Liberty and Necessity 69 96 19 See endnote p. PART II There is no method of reasoning more common and yet none more blameable than in philosophical disputes to endeavour the refu tation of any hypothesis by a pretence of its dangerous consequences to religion and morality. When any opinion leads to absurdities it is certainly false but it is not certain that an opinion is false because it is of dangerous consequence. Such topics therefore ought entirely to be forborne as serving nothing to the discovery of truth but only to make the person of an antagonist odious. This I observe in general without pretending to draw any advantage from it. I frankly submit to an examination of this kind and shall venture to arm that the doc trines both of necessity and of liberty as above explained are not only consistent with morality but are absolutely essential to its support. Necessity may be dened two ways conformably to the two denitions of cause of which it makes an essential part. It consists either in the constant conjunction of like objects or in the inference of the understanding from one object to another. Now necessity in both these senses which indeed are at bottom the same has universally though tacitly in the schools in the pulpit and in common life been allowed to belong to the will of man and no one has ever pretended to deny that we can draw inferences concerning human actions and that those inferences are founded on the experienced union of like actions with like motives inclinations and circumstances. The only particu lar in which any one can dier is that either perhaps he will refuse to give the name of necessity to this property of human actions But as long as the meaning is understood I hope the word can do no harm Or that he will maintain it possible to discover something farther in the operations of matter. But this it must be acknowledged can be of no consequence to morality or religion whatever it may be to natural phi losophy or metaphysics. We may here be mistaken in asserting that there is no idea of any other necessity or connexion in the actions of body But surely we ascribe nothing to the actions of the mind but what every one does and must readily allow of. We change no circum stance in the received orthodox system with regard to the will but only in that with regard to material objects and causes. Nothing therefore can be more innocent at least than this doctrine. All laws being founded on rewards and punishments it is sup posed as a fundamental principle that these motives have a regular Section VIII 70 97 98 and uniform inuence on the mind and both produce the good and prevent the evil actions. We may give to this inuence what name we please but as it is usually conjoined with the action it must be esteemed a cause and be looked upon as an instance of that necessity which we would here establish. The only proper object of hatred or vengeance is a person or creature endowed with thought and consciousness and when any criminal or injurious actions excite that passion it is only by their relation to the person or connexion with him. Actions are by their very nature temporary and perishing and where they proceed not from some cause in the character and disposition of the person who performed them they can neither redound to his honour if good nor infamy if evil. The actions themselves may be blameable they may be contrary to all the rules of morality and religion But the person is not answerable for them and as they proceeded from nothing in him that is durable and constant and leave nothing of that nature behind them it is impossible he can upon their account become the object of punishment or vengeance. According to the principle therefore which denies necessity and consequently causes a man is as pure and untainted after having committed the most horrid crime as at the rst moment of his birth nor is his character any wise concerned in his actions since they are not derived from it and the wickedness of the one can never be used as a proof of the depravity of the other. Men are not blamed for such actions as they perform igno rantly and casually whatever may be the consequences. Why but because the principles of these actions are only momentary and terminate in them alone. Men are less blamed for such actions as they perform hastily and unpremeditately than for such as proceed from deliberation. For what reason but because a hasty temper though a constant cause or principle in the mind operates only by intervals and infects not the whole character. Again repentance wipes oevery crime if attended with a reformation of life and manners. How is this to be accounted for but by asserting that actions render a person criminal merely as they are proofs of criminal principles in the mind and when by an alteration of these principles they cease to be just proofs they likewise cease to be criminal. But except upon the doctrine of necessity they never were just proofs and consequently never were criminal. Of Liberty and Necessity 71 99 It will be equally easy to prove and from the same arguments that liberty according to that denition above mentioned in which all men agree is also essential to morality and that no human actions where it is wanting are susceptible of any moral qualities or can be the objects either of approbation or dislike. For as actions are objects of our moral sentiment so far only as they are indications of the internal character passions and aections it is impossible that they can give rise either to praise or blame where they proceed not from these prin ciples but are derived altogether from external violence. I pretend not to have obviated or removed all objections to this theory with regard to necessity and liberty. I can foresee other objec tions derived from topics which have not here been treated of. It may be said for instance that if voluntary actions be subjected to the same laws of necessity with the operations of matter there is a continued chain of necessary causes preordained and predetermined reaching from the original cause of all to every single volition of every human creature. No contingency any where in the universe no indierence no liberty. While we act we are at the same time acted upon. The ultimate Author of all our volitions is the Creator of the world who rst bestowed motion on this immense machine and placed all beings in that particular position whence every subsequent event by an inevitable necessity must result. Human actions therefore either can have no moral turpitude at all as proceeding from so good a cause or if they have any turpitude they must involve our Creator in the same guilt while he is acknowledged to be their ultimate cause and author. For as a man who red a mine is answerable for all the consequences whether the train he employed be long or short so wherever a continued chain of necessary causes is xed that Being either nite or innite who produces the rst is likewise the author of all the rest and must both bear the blame and acquire the praise which belong to them. Our clear and unalterable ideas of morality establish this rule upon unquestionable reasons when we examine the consequences of any human action and these reasons must still have greater force when applied to the volitions and intentions of a Being innitely wise and powerful. Ignorance or impotence may be pleaded for so limited a creature as man but those imperfections have no place in our Creator. He foresaw he ordained he intended all those actions of men which we so rashly pronounce criminal. And we must therefore conclude either that they are not criminal or that Section VIII 72 100 the Deity not man is accountable for them. But as either of these positions is absurd and impious it follows that the doctrine from which they are deduced cannot possibly be true as being liable to all the same objections. An absurd consequence if necessary proves the original doctrine to be absurd in the same manner as criminal actions render criminal the original cause if the connexion between them be necessary and inevitable. This objection consists of two parts which we shall examine separately First that if human actions can be traced up by a neces sary chain to the Deity they can never be criminal on account of the innite perfection of that Being from whom they are derived and who can intend nothing but what is altogether good and laudable. Or Secondly if they be criminal we must retract the attribute of perfection which we ascribe to the Deity and must acknowledge him to be the ultimate author of guilt and moral turpitude in all his creatures. The answer to the rst objection seems obvious and convinc ing. There are many philosophers who after an exact scrutiny of all the phaenomena of nature conclude that the Whole considered as one system is in every period of its existence ordered with perfect benevolence and that the utmost possible happiness will in the end result to all created beings without any mixture of positive or absolute ill and misery. Every physical ill say they makes an essential part of this benevolent system and could not possibly be removed even by the Deity himself considered as a wise agent without giving entrance to greater ill or excluding greater good which will result from it. From this theory some philosophers and the ancient Stoics among the rest derived a topic of consolation under all afictions while they taught their pupils that those ills under which they laboured were in reality goods to the universe and that to an enlarged view which could comprehend the whole system of nature every event became an object of joy and exultation. But though this topic be specious and sub lime it was soon found in practice weak and ineectual. You would surely more irritate than appease a man lying under the racking pains of the gout by preaching up to him the rectitude of those general laws which produced the malignant humours in his body and led them through the proper canals to the sinews and nerves where they now excite such acute torments. These enlarged views may for a moment please the imagination of a speculative man who is placed in ease and security but neither can they dwell with constancy on his mind even Of Liberty and Necessity 73 101 though undisturbed by the emotions of pain or passion much less can they maintain their ground when attacked by such powerful antagonists. The aections take a narrower and more natural survey of their object and by an oeconomy more suitable to the inrmity of human minds regard alone the beings around us and are actuated by such events as appear good or ill to the private system. The case is the same with moral as with physical ill. It cannot reasonably be supposed that those remote considerations which are found of so little ecacy with regard to one will have a more powerful inuence with regard to the other. The mind of man is so formed by nature that upon the appearance of certain characters dispositions and actions it immediately feels the sentiment of approbation or blame nor are there any emotions more essential to its frame and constitution. The characters which engage our approbation are chiey such as con tribute to the peace and security of human society as the characters which excite blame are chiey such as tend to public detriment and disturbance Whence it may reasonably be presumed that the moral sentiments arise either mediately or immediately from a reection on these opposite interests. What though philosophical meditations estab lish a dierent opinion or conjecture that every thing is right with regard to the whole and that the qualities which disturb society are in the main as benecial and are as suitable to the primary intention of nature as those which more directly promote its happiness and welfare Are such remote and uncertain speculations able to counterbalance the sentiments which arise from the natural and immediate view of the objects a man who is robbed of a considerable sum does he nd his vexation for the loss any wise diminished by these sublime reections Why then should his moral resentment against the crime be supposed incompatible with them Or why should not the acknowledgment of a real distinction between vice and virtue be reconcileable to all specu lative systems of philosophy as well as that of a real distinction between personal beauty and deformity Both these distinctions are founded in the natural sentiments of the human mind And these sentiments are not to be controuled or altered by any philosophical theory or specula tion whatsoever. The second objection admits not of so easy and satisfactory an answer nor is it possible to explain distinctly how the Deity can be the mediate cause of all the actions of men without being the author of sin and moral turpitude. These are mysteries which mere natural Section VIII 74 102 103 and unassisted reason is very unt to handle and whatever system she embraces she must nd herself involved in inextricable diculties and even contradictions at every step which she takes with regard to such subjects. To reconcile the indierence and contingency of human actions with prescience or to defend absolute decrees and yet free the Deity from being the author of sin has been found hitherto to exceed all the power of philosophy. Happy if she be thence sensible of her temerity when she pries into these sublime mysteries and leaving a scene so full of obscurities and perplexities return with suitable modesty to her true and proper province the examination of common life where she will nd diculties enow to employ her enquiries without launching into so boundless an ocean of doubt uncertainty and contradiction Of Liberty and Necessity 75 SECTION IX Of the Reason of Animals a ll our reasonings concerning matter of fact are founded on a species of Analogy which leads us to expect from any cause the same events which we have observed to result from similar causes. Where the causes are entirely similar the analogy is perfect and the inference drawn from it is regarded as certain and conclusive Nor does any man ever entertain a doubt where he sees a piece of iron that it will have weight and cohesion of parts as in all other instances which have ever fallen under his observation. But where the objects have not so exact a similarity the analogy is less perfect and the inference is less conclusive though still it has some force in proportion to the degree of similarity and resemblance. The anatomical observations formed upon one animal are by this species of reasoning extended to all animals and it is certain that when the circulation of the blood for instance is clearly proved to have place in one creature as a frog or sh it forms a strong presumption that the same principle has place in all. These analogical observations may be carried farther even to this science of which we are now treating and any theory by which we explain the operations of the understanding or the origin and connex ion of the passions in man will acquire additional authority if we nd that the same theory is requisite to explain the same phaenomena in all other animals. We shall make trial of this with regard to the hypothesis by which we have in the foregoing discourse endeavoured to account for all experimental reasonings and it is hoped that this new point of view will serve to conrm all our former observations. First It seems evident that animals as well as men learn many things from experience and infer that the same events will always follow from the same causes. By this principle they become acquainted with the more obvious properties of external objects and gradually from their birth treasure up a knowledge of the nature of re water earth stones heights depths c. The ignorance and inexperience of the young are here plainly distinguishable from the cunning and sagacity of the old who have learned by long observation to avoid what hurt them 104 105 and to pursue what gave ease or pleasure. A horse that has been accus tomed to the eld becomes acquainted with the proper height which he can leap and will never attempt what exceeds his force and ability. An old greyhound will trust the more fatiguing part of the chace to the younger and will place himself so as to meet the hare in her doubles nor are the conjectures which he forms on this occasion founded in any thing but his observation and experience. This is still more evident from the eects of discipline and education on animals who by the proper Application of rewards and punishments may be taught any course of action the most contrary to their natural instincts and propensities. Is it not experience which renders a dog apprehensive of pain when you menace him or lift up the whip to beat him Is it not even experience which makes him answer to his name and infer from such an arbitrary sound that you mean him rather than any of his fellows and intend to call him when you pronounce it in a certain manner and with a certain tone and accent In all these cases we may observe that the animal infers some fact beyond what immediately strikes his senses and that this inference is altogether founded on past experience while the creature expects from the present object the same consequences which it has always found in its observation to result from similar objects. Secondly It is impossible that this inference of the animal can be founded on any process of argument or reasoning by which he concludes that like events must follow like objects and that the course of nature will always be regular in its operations. For if there be in reality any arguments of this nature they surely lie too abstruse for the observation of such imperfect understandings since it may well employ the utmost care and attention of a philosophic genius to discover and observe them. Animals therefore are not guided in these inferences by reasoning Neither are children Neither are the generality of mankind in their ordinary actions and conclusions Neither are philosophers themselves who in all the active parts of life are in the main the same with the vulgar and are governed by the same maxims. Nature must have provided some other principle of more ready and more general use and Application nor can an operation of such immense consequence in life as that of inferring eects from causes be trusted to the uncertain process of reasoning and argumentation. Were this doubtful with regard to men it seems Of the Reason of Animals 77 106 to admit of no question with regard to the brute creation and the conclusion being once rmly established in the one we have a strong presumption from all the rules of analogy that it ought to be univer sally admitted without any exception or reserve. It is custom alone which engages animals from every object that strikes their senses to infer its usual attendant and carries their imagination from the appearance of the one to conceive the other in that particular manner which we denominate belief. No other explication can be given of this operation in all the higher as well as lower classes of sensitive beings which fall under our notice an. But though animals learn many parts of their knowledge from observation there are also many parts of it which they derive from the original hand of nature which much exceed the share of capacity they possess on ordinary occasions and in which they improve little or nothing by the longest practice and experience. These we denominate Instincts and are so apt to admire as something very extraordinary and inexplicable by all the disquisitions of human understanding. But our wonder will perhaps cease or diminish when we consider that the experimental reasoning itself which we possess in common with beasts and on which the whole conduct of life depends is nothing but a species of instinct or mechanical power that acts in us unknown to ourselves and in its chief operations is not directed by any such relations or comparisons of ideas as are the proper objects of our intellectual faculties. Though the instinct be dierent yet still it is an instinct which teaches a man to avoid the re as much as that which teaches a bird with such exactness the art of incubation and the whole oeconomy and order of its nursery. Section IX 78 107 108 20 See endnote p. SECTION X Of Miracles PART I T here is in Dr. Tillotsons writings an argument against the real presence which is as concise and elegant and strong as any argument can possibly be supposed against a doctrine so little worthy of a serious refutation. It is acknowledged on all hands says that learned prelate that the authority either of the scripture or of tradition is founded merely in the testimony of the apostles who were eyewitnesses to those miracles of our Saviour by which he proved his divine mission. Our evidence then for the truth of the Christian religion is less than the evidence for the truth of our senses because even in the rst authors of our religion it was no greater and it is evident it must diminish in passing from them to their dis ciples nor can any one rest such condence in their testimony as in the immediate object of his senses. But a weaker evidence can never destroy a stronger and therefore were the doctrine of the real pres ence ever so clearly revealed in scripture it were directly contrary to the rules of just reasoning to give our assent to it. It contradicts sense though both the scripture and tradition on which it is supposed to be built carry not such evidence with them as sense when they are considered merely as external evidences and are not brought home to every ones breast by the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit. Nothing is so convenient as a decisive argument of this kind which must at least silence the most arrogant bigotry and supersti tion and free us from their impertinent solicitations. I atter myself that I have discovered an argument of a like nature which if just will with the wise and learned be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion and consequently will be useful as long as the world endures. For so long I presume will the accounts of miracles and prodigies be found in all history sacred and profane. Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact it must be acknowledged that this guide is not altogether infallible but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors. 09 110 Section X One who in our climate should expect better weather in any week of June than in one of December would reason justly and conformably to experience but it is certain that he may happen in the event to nd himself mistaken. However we may observe that in such a case he would have no cause to complain of experience because it commonly informs us beforehand of the uncertainty by that contrar iety of events which we may learn from a diligent observation. All eects follow not with like certainty from their supposed causes. Some events are found in all countries and all ages to have been constantly conjoined together Others are found to have been more variable and sometimes to disappoint our expectations so that in our reasonings concerning matter of fact there are all imaginable degrees of assurance from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence. A wise man therefore proportions his belief to the evidence. In such conclusions as are founded on an infallible experience he expects the event with the last degree of assurance and regards his past experience as a full proof of the future existence of that event. In other cases he proceeds with more caution He weighs the opposite experiments He considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments To that side he inclines with doubt and hesi tation and when at last he xes his judgment the evidence exceeds not what we properly call probability. All probability then supposes an opposition of experiments and observations where the one side is found to overbalance the other and to produce a degree of evidence proportioned to the superiority. A hundred instances or experiments on one side and fty on another aord a doubtful expectation of any event though a hundred uniform experiments with only one that is contradictory reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases we must balance the opposite experiments where they are opposite and deduct the smaller number from the greater in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence. To apply these principles to a particular instance we may observe that there is no species of reasoning more common more useful and even necessary to human life than that which is derived from the testimony of men and the reports of eyewitnesses and spectators. This species of reasoning perhaps one may deny to be founded on the relation of cause and eect. I shall not dispute about a word. It will be sucient to observe that our assurance in any argument of this kind is derived from no other principle than our 80 111 Of Miracles observation of the veracity of human testimony and of the usual con formity of facts to the reports of witnesses. It being a general maxim that no objects have any discoverable connexion together and that all the inferences which we can draw from one to another are founded merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction it is evident that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony whose connexion with any event seems in itself as little necessary as any other. Were not the memory tenacious to a certain degree had not men commonly an inclination to truth and a principle of probity were they not sensible to shame when detected in a falsehood Were not these I say discovered by experience to be qualities inherent in human nature we should never repose the least condence in human testimony. A man delirious or noted for false hood and villany has no manner of authority with us. And as the evidence derived from witnesses and human testi mony is founded on past experience so it varies with the experience and is regarded either as a proof or a probability according as the con junction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object has been found to be constant or variable. There are a number of cir cumstances to be taken into consideration in all judgments of this kind and the ultimate standard by which we determine all disputes that may arise concerning them is always derived from experience and observation. Where this experience is not entirely uniform on any side it is attended with an unavoidable contrariety in our judgments and with the same opposition and mutual destruction of argument as in every other kind of evidence. We frequently hesitate concerning the reports of others. We balance the opposite circumstances which cause any doubt or uncertainty and when we discover a superiority on any side we incline to it but still with a diminution of assurance in pro portion to the force of its antagonist. This contrariety of evidence in the present case may be derived from several dierent causes from the opposition of contrary testimony from the character or number of the witnesses from the manner of their delivering their testimony or from the union of all these circum stances. We entertain a suspicion concerning any matter of fact when the witnesses contradict each other when they are but few or of a doubtful character when they have an interest in what they arm when they deliver their testimony with hesitation or on the contrary with too violent asseverations. There are many other particulars of 81 112 113 Section X 82 the same kind which may diminish or destroy the force of any argu ment derived from human testimony. Suppose for instance that the fact which the testimony endeav ours to establish partakes of the extraordinary and the marvellous in that case the evidence resulting from the testimony admits of a diminution greater or less in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual. The reason why we place any credit in witnesses and historians is not derived from any connexion which we perceive priori between testi mony and reality but because we are accustomed to nd a conformity between them. But when the fact attested is such a one as has seldom fallen under our observation here is a contest of two opposite experi ences of which the one destroys the other as far as its force goes and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force which remains. The very same principle of experience which gives us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of witnesses gives us also in this case another degree of assurance against the fact which they endeavour to establish from which contradiction there necessarily arises a counter poize and mutual destruction of belief and authority. I should not believe such a story were it told me by Cato was a proverbial saying in Rome even during the lifetime of that philo sophical patriot 21. The incredibility of a fact it was allowed might invalidate so great an authority. The Indian prince who refused to believe the rst relations concerning the eects of frost reasoned justly and it naturally required very strong testimony to engage his assent to facts that arose from a state of nature with which he was unacquainted and which bore so little analogy to those events of which he had had constant and uniform experience. Though they were not contrary to his experience they were not conformable to it 22. But in order to encrease the probability against the testimony of witnesses let us suppose that the fact which they arm instead of being only marvellous is really miraculous and suppose also that the testimony considered apart and in itself amounts to an entire proof in that case there is proof against proof of which the strongest must prevail but still with a diminution of its force in proportion to that of its antagonist. 14 21 Plutarch in vita Catonis. 2 See endnote p. Of Miracles 83 a miracle is a violation of the laws of nature and as a rm and unalterable experience has established these laws the proof against a miracle from the very nature of the fact is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined. Why is it more than prob able that all men must die that lead cannot of itself remain suspended in the air that re consumes wood and is extinguished by water unless it be that these events are found agreeable to the laws of nature and there is required a violation of these laws or in other words a miracle to prevent them Nothing is esteemed a miracle if it ever happen in the common course of nature. It is no miracle that a man seemingly in good health should die on a sudden because such a kind of death though more unusual than any other has yet been frequently observed to happen. But it is a miracle that a dead man should come to life because that has never been observed in any age or country. There must therefore be a uniform experience against every miraculous event otherwise the event would not merit that appellation. And as an uniform experience amounts to a proof there is here a direct and full proof from the nature of the fact against the existence of any miracle nor can such a proof be destroyed or the miracle rendered credible but by an opposite proof which i. The plain consequence is and it is a general maxim worthy of our attention That no testimony is sucient to establish a mir acle unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish And even in that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force which remains after deducting the inferior. When any one tells me that he saw a dead man restored to life I immediately consider with myself whether it be more probable that this person should either deceive or be deceived or that the fact which he relates should really have happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other and according to the superiority which I discover I pro nounce my decision and always reject the greater miracle. If the falsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous than the event which he relates then and not till then can he pretend to command my belief or opinion. 15 116 23 See endnote p. Section X 84 PART II In the foregoing reasoning we have supposed that the testimony upon which a miracle is founded may possibly amount to an entire proof and that the falsehood of that testimony would be a real prodigy But it is easy to shew that we have been a great deal too lib eral in our concession and that there never was a miraculous event established on so full an evidence. For rst there is not to be found in all history any miracle attested by a sucient number of men of such unquestioned good sense education and learning as to secure us against all delusion in themselves of such undoubted integrity as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others of such credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being detected in any falsehood and at the same time attesting facts performed in such a public manner and in so celebrated a part of the world as to render the detection unavoidable All which circumstances are requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men. We may observe in human nature a principle which if strictly examined will be found to diminish extremely the assurance which we might from human testimony have in any kind of prodigy. The maxim by which we commonly conduct ourselves in our reason ings is that the objects of which we have no experience resemble those of which we have that what we have found to be most usual is always most probable and that where there is an opposition of argu ments we ought to give the preference to such as are founded on the greatest number of past observations. But though in proceeding by this rule we readily reject any fact which is unusual and incredible in an ordinary degree yet in advancing farther the mind observes not always the same rule but when any thing is armed utterly absurd and miraculous it rather the more readily admits of such a fact upon account of that very circumstance which ought to destroy all its authority. The passion of surprize and wonder arising from miracles being an agreeable emotion gives a sensible tendency towards the belief of those events from which it is derived. And this goes so far that even those who cannot enjoy this pleasure immediately nor can believe those miraculous events of which they are informed yet love to partake of the satisfaction at secondhand or by rebound and place a pride and delight in exciting the admiration of others. 17 Of Miracles With what greediness are the miraculous accounts of trav ellers received their descriptions of sea and land monsters their rela tions of wonderful adventures strange men and uncouth manners But if the spirit of religion join itself to the love of wonder there is an end of common sense and human testimony in these circumstances loses all pretensions to authority. A religionist may be an enthusiast and imagine he sees what has no reality He may know his narrative to be false and yet persevere in it with the best intentions in the world for the sake of promoting so holy a cause Or even where this delusion has not place vanity excited by so strong a temptation operates on him more powerfully than on the rest of mankind in any other cir cumstances and selfinterest with equal force. His auditors may not have and commonly have not sucient judgment to canvass his evi dence What judgment they have they renounce by principle in these sublime and mysterious subjects Or if they were ever so willing to employ it passion and a heated imagination disturb the regularity of its operations. Their credulity encreases his impudence And his impu dence overpowers their credulity. Eloquence when at its highest pitch leaves little room for reason or reection but addressing itself entirely to the fancy or the aections captivates the willing hearers and subdues their under standing. Happily this pitch it seldom attains. But what a Tully or a Demosthenes could scarcely eect over a Roman or Athenian audience every Capuchin every itinerant or stationary teacher can perform over the generality of mankind and in a higher degree by touching such gross and vulgar passions. The many instances of forged miracles and prophecies and supernatural events which in all ages have either been detected by contrary evidence or which detect themselves by their absurdity prove suciently the strong propensity of mankind to the extraordin ary and the marvellous and ought reasonably to beget a suspicion against all relations of this kind. This is our natural way of thinking even with regard to the most common and most credible events. For instance There is no kind of report which rises so easily and spreads so quickly especially in country places and provincial towns as those concerning marriages insomuch that two young persons of equal condition never see each other twice but the whole neighbourhood immediately join them together. The pleasure of telling a piece of news so interesting of propagating it and of being the rst reporters 85 118 119 Section X of it spreads the intelligence. And this is so well known that no man of sense gives attention to these reports till he nd them conrmed by some greater evidence. Do not the same passions and others still stronger incline the generality of mankind to believe and report with the greatest vehemence and assurance all religious miracles Thirdly. It forms a strong presumption against all supernatural and miraculous relations that they are observed chiey to abound among ignorant and barbarous nations or if a civilized people has ever given admission to any of them that people will be found to have received them from ignorant and barbarous ancestors who transmitted them with that inviolable sanction and authority which always attend received opinions. When we peruse the rst histories of all nations we are apt to imagine ourselves transported into some new world where the whole frame of nature is disjointed and every element performs its operations in a dierent manner from what it does at present. Battles revolutions pestilence famine and death are never the eect of those natural causes which we experience. Prodigies omens oracles judg ments quite obscure the few natural events that are intermingled with them. But as the former grow thinner every page in proportion as we advance nearer the enlightened ages we soon learn that there is noth ing mysterious or supernatural in the case but that all proceeds from the usual propensity of mankind towards the marvellous and that though this inclination may at intervals receive a check from sense and learning it can never be thoroughly extirpated from human nature. It is strange a judicious reader is apt to say upon the perusal of these wonderful historians that such prodigious events never happen in our days. But it is nothing strange I hope that men should lie in all ages. You must surely have seen instances enow of that frailty. You have yourself heard many such marvellous relations started which being treated with scorn by all the wise and judicious have at last been abandoned even by the vulgar. Be assured that those renowned lies which have spread and ourished to such a monstrous height arose from like beginnings but being sown in a more proper soil shot up at last into prodigies almost equal to those which they relate. It was a wise policy in that false prophet Alexander who though now forgotten was once so famous to lay the rst scene of his impostures in Paphlagonia where as Lucian tells us the people were extremely ignorant and stupid and ready to swallow even the grossest delusion. People at a distance who are weak enough to think 86 120 Of Miracles the matter at all worth enquiry have no opportunity of receiving better information. The stories come magnied to them by a hundred circumstances. Fools are industrious in propagating the imposture while the wise and learned are contented in general to deride its absurd ity without informing themselves of the particular facts by which it may be distinctly refuted. And thus the impostor abovementioned was enabled to proceed from his ignorant Paphlagonians to the enlisting of votaries even among the Grecian philosophers and men of the most eminent rank and distinction in Rome Nay could engage the attention of that sage emperor Marcus Aurelius so far as to make him trust the success of a military expedition to his delusive prophecies. The advantages are so great of starting an imposture among an ignorant people that even though the delusion should be too gross to impose on the generality of them which though seldom is sometimes the case it has a much better chance for succeeding in remote countries than if the rst scene had been laid in a city renowned for arts and knowledge. The most ignorant and barbarous of these barbarians carry the report abroad. None of their countrymen have a large corre spondence or sucient credit and authority to contradict and beat down the delusion. Mens inclination to the marvellous has full oppor tunity to display itself. And thus a story which is universally exploded in the place where it was rst started shall pass for certain at a thousand miles distance. But had Alexander xed his residence at Athens the philosophers of that renowned mart of learning had immediately spread throughout the whole Roman empire their sense of the matter which being supported by so great authority and displayed by all the force of reason and eloquence had entirely opened the eyes of mankind. It is true Lucian passing by chance through Paphlagonia had an opportunity of performing this good oce. But though much to be wished it does not always happen that every Alexander meets with a Lucian ready to expose and detect his impostures. I may add as a fourth reason which diminishes the authority of prodigies that there is no testimony for any even those which have not been expressly detected that is not opposed by an innite number of witnesses so that not only the miracle destroys the credit of testimony but the testimony destroys itself. To make this the better understood let us consider that in matters of religion whatever is 87 121 Section X 88 dierent is contrary and that it is impossible the religions of ancient Rome of Turkey of Siam and of China should all of them be established on any solid foundation. Every miracle therefore pre tended to have been wrought in any of these religions and all of them abound in miracles as its direct scope is to establish the particular system to which it is attributed so has it the same force though more indirectly to overthrow every other system. In destroying a rival system it likewise destroys the credit of those miracles on which that system was established so that all the prodigies of dierent reli gions are to be regarded as contrary facts and the evidences of these prodigies whether weak or strong as opposite to each other. According to this method of reasoning when we believe any miracle of Mahomet or his successors we have for our warrant the testimony of a few bar barous Arabians And on the other hand we are to regard the authority of Titus Livius Plutarch Tacitus and in short of all the authors and witnesses Grecian Chinese and Roman Catholic who have related any miracle in their particular religion I say we are to regard their testimony in the same light as if they had mentioned that Mahometan miracle and had in express terms contradicted it with the same certainty as they have for the miracle they relate. This argument may appear over subtile and rened but is not in reality dierent from the reasoning of a judge who supposes that the credit of two witnesses maintaining a crime against any one is destroyed by the testimony of two others who arm him to have been two hundred leagues distant at the same instant when the crime is said to have been committed. One of the best attested miracles in all profane history is that which Tacitus reports of Vespasian who cured a blind man in Alexandria by means of his spittle and a lame man by the mere touch of his foot in obedience to a vision of the god Serapis who had enjoined them to have recourse to the Emperor for these miracu lous cures. The story may be seen in that ne where every circumstance seems to add weight to the testimony and might be displayed at large with all the force of argument and eloquence if any one were now concerned to enforce the evidence of that exploded and idolatrous superstition. The gravity solidity age and probity of so great an emperor who through the whole course of his life conversed 122 123 24 Hist. Suetonius gives nearly the same account in vita Vesp. Of Miracles in a familiar manner with his friends and courtiers and never aected those extraordinary airs of divinity assumed by Alexander and Demetrius. The historian a cotemporary writer noted for candour and veracity and withal the greatest and most penetrating genius perhaps of all antiquity and so free from any tendency to credulity that he even lies under the contrary imputation of atheism and pro faneness The persons from whose authority he related the miracle of established character for judgment and veracity as we may well presume eyewitnesses of the fact and conrming their testimony after the Flavian family was despoiled of the empire and could no longer give any reward as the price of a lie. Utrumque qui interfuere nunc quoque memorant postquam nullum mendacio pretium. To which if we add the public nature of the facts as related it will appear that no evidence can well be supposed stronger for so gross and so palp able a falsehood. There is also a memorable story related by Cardinal de Retz which may well deserve our consideration. When that intriguing politician ed into Spain to avoid the persecution of his enemies he passed through Saragossa the capital of Arragon where he was shewn in the cathedral a man who had served seven years as a door keeper and was well known to every body in town that had ever paid his devotions at that church. He had been seen for so long a time wanting a leg but recovered that limb by the rubbing of holy oil upon the stump and the cardinal assures us that he saw him with two legs. This miracle was vouched by all the canons of the church and the whole company in town were appealed to for a conrmation of the fact whom the cardinal found by their zealous devotion to be thor ough believers of the miracle. Here the relater was also cotemporary to the supposed prodigy of an incredulous and libertine character as well as of great genius the miracle of so singular a nature as could scarcely admit of a counterfeit and the witnesses very numerous and all of them in a manner spectators of the fact to which they gave their tes timony. And what adds mightily to the force of the evidence and may double our surprize on this occasion is that the cardinal himself who relates the story seems not to give any credit to it and consequently cannot be suspected of any concurrence in the holy fraud. He consid ered justly that it was not requisite in order to reject a fact of this nature to be able accurately to disprove the testimony and to trace its falsehood through all the circumstances of knavery and credulity which 89 124 Section X 90 produced it. He knew that as this was commonly altogether impossible at any small distance of time and place so was it extremely dicult even where one was immediately present by reason of the bigotry ignorance cunning and roguery of a great part of mankind. He therefore con cluded like a just reasoner that such an evidence carried falsehood upon the very face of it and that a miracle supported by any human testi mony was more properly a subject of derision than of argument. There surely never was a greater number of miracles ascribed to one person than those which were lately said to have been wrought in France upon the tomb of Abb Paris the famous Jansenist with whose sanctity the people were so long deluded. The curing of the sick giving hearing to the deaf and sight to the blind were every where talked of as the usual eects of that holy sepulchre. But what is more extraordinary many of the miracles were immediately proved upon the spot before judges of unquestioned integrity attested by witnesses of credit and distinction in a learned age and on the most eminent theatre that is now in the world. Nor is this all a relation of them was published and dispersed every where nor were the Jesuits though a learned body supported by the civil magistrate and deter mined enemies to those opinions in whose favour the miracles were said to have been wrought ever able distinctly to refute or detec. Where shall we nd such a number of circumstances agreeing to the corroboration of one fact And what have we to oppose to such a cloud of witnesses but the absolute impossibility or miraculous nature of the events which they relate And this surely in the eyes of all reasonable people will alone be regarded as a sucient refutation. Is the consequence just because some human testimony has the utmost force and authority in some cases when it relates the battle of Philippi or Pharsalia for instance that therefore all kinds of testimony must in all cases have equal force and authority Suppose that the Caesarean and Pompeian factions had each of them claimed the victory in these battles and that the historians of each party had uniformly ascribed the advantage to their own side how could mankind at this distance have been able to determine between them The contrariety is equally strong between the miracles related by Herodotus or Plutarch and those delivered by Mariana Bede or any monkish historian. 25 25 See endnote p. Of Miracles 91 The wise lend a very academic faith to every report which favours the passion of the reporter whether it magnies his country his family or himself or in any other way strikes in with his natural inclinations and propensities. But what greater temptation than to appear a missionary a prophet an ambassador from heaven Who would not encounter many dangers and diculties in order to attain so sublime a character Or if by the help of vanity and a heated imag ination a man has rst made a convert of himself and entered seri ously into the delusion who ever scruples to make use of pious frauds in support of so holy and meritorious a cause The smallest spark may here kindle into the greatest ame because the materials are always prepared for it. The avidum genus the gazing populace receive greedily without exam ination whatever sooths superstition and promotes wonder. How many stories of this nature have in all ages been detected and exploded in their infancy How many more have been celebrated for a time and have afterwards sunk into neglect and oblivion Where such reports therefore y about the solution of the phaenomenon is obvious and we judge in conformity to regular experience and obser vation when we account for it by the known and natural principles of credulity and delusion. And shall we rather than have a recourse to so natural a solution allow of a miraculous violation of the most estab lished laws of nature I need not mention the diculty of detecting a falsehood in any private or even public history at the place where it is said to happen much more when the scene is removed to ever so small a dis tance. Even a court of judicature with all the authority accuracy and judgment which they can employ nd themselves often at a loss to distinguish between truth and falsehood in the most recent actions. But the matter never comes to any issue if trusted to the common method of altercation and debate and ying rumours especially when mens passions have taken part on either side. In the infancy of new religions the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat in order to undeceive the deluded multitude the season is now past 126 26 Lucret. Section X 92 and the records and witnesses which might clear up the matter have perished beyond recovery. No means of detection remain but those which must be drawn from the very testimony itself of the reporters And these though always sucient with the judicious and knowing are commonly too ne to fall under the comprehension of the vulgar. Upon the whole then it appears that no testimony for any kind of miracle has ever amounted to a probability much less to a proof and that even supposing it amounted to a proof it would be opposed by another proof derived from the very nature of the fact which it would endeavour to establish. It is experience only which gives authority to human testimony and it is the same experience which assures us of the laws of nature. When therefore these two kinds of experience are con trary we have nothing to do but substract the one from the other and embrace an opinion either on one side or the other with that assurance which arises from the remainder. But according to the principle here explained this substraction with regard to all popular religions amounts to an entire annihilation and therefore we may establish it as a maxim that no human testimony can have such force as to prove a miracle and make it a just foundation for any such system of religion. I beg the limitations here made may be remarked when I say that a miracle can never be proved so as to be the foundation of a system of religion. For I own that otherwise there may possibly be miracles or violations of the usual course of nature of such a kind as to admit of proof from human testimony though perhaps it will be impossible to nd any such in all the records of history. Thus suppose all authors in all languages agree that from the rst of January there was a total darkness over the whole earth for eight days Suppose that the tradition of this extraordinary event is still strong and lively among the people That all travellers who return from foreign countries bring us accounts of the same tradition without the least variation or contradiction It is evident that our present philosophers instead of doubting the fact ought to receive it as certain and ought to Search for the causes whence it might be derived. The decay corruption and dissolution of nature is an event rendered probable by so many analogies that any phaenomenon which seems to have a tendency towards that catastrophe comes within the reach of human testimony if that testimony be very extensive and uniform. But suppose that all the historians who treat of England should agree that on the rst of January Queen Elizabeth 127 128 Of Miracles died that both before and after her death she was seen by her physi cians and the whole court as is usual with persons of her rank that her successor was acknowledged and proclaimed by the parliament and that after being interred a month she again appeared resumed the throne and governed England for three years I must confess that I should be surprized at the concurrence of so many odd circum stances but should not have the least inclination to believe so miracu lous an event. I should not doubt of her pretended death and of those other public circumstances that followed it I should only assert it to have been pretended and that it neither was nor possibly could be real. You would in vain object to me the diculty and almost impos sibility of deceiving the world in an aair of such consequence the wisdom and solid judgment of that renowned queen with the little or no advantage which she could reap from so poor an artice All this might astonish me but I would still reply that the knavery and folly of men are such common phaenomena that I should rather believe the most extraordinary events to arise from their concurrence than admit of so signal a violation of the laws of nature. But should this miracle be ascribed to any new system of religion men in all ages have been so much imposed on by ridicu lous stories of that kind that this very circumstance would be a full proof of a cheat and sucient with all men of sense not only to make them reject the fact but even reject it without farther exami nation. Though the Being to whom the miracle is ascribed be in this case Almighty it does not upon that account become a whit more probable since it is impossible for us to know the attributes or actions of such a Being otherwise than from the experience which we have of his productions in the usual course of nature. This still reduces us to past observation and obliges us to compare the instances of the viola tion of truth in the testimony of men with those of the violation of the laws of nature by miracles in order to judge which of them is most likely and probable. As the violations of truth are more common in the testimony concerning religious miracles than in that concerning any other matter of fact this must diminish very much the authority of the former testimony and make us form a general resolution never to lend any attention to it with whatever specious pretence it may be covered. Lord Bacon seems to have embraced the same principles of reasoning. We ought says he to make a collection or particular history of all monsters and prodigious births or productions and in a 93 129 Section X 94 word of every thing new rare and extraordinary in nature. But this must be done with the most severe scrutiny lest we depart from truth. Above all every relation must be considered as suspicious which depends in any degree upon religion as the prodigies of Livy And no less so every thing that is to be found in the writers of natural magic or alchimy or such authors who seem all of them to have an uncon querable appetite for falsehood and fable 27. I am the better pleased with the method of reasoning here delivered as I think it may serve to confound those dangerous friends or disguised enemies to the Christian Religion who have undertaken to defend it by the principles of human reason. Our most holy religion is founded on Faith not on reason and it is a sure method of exposing it to put it to such a trial as it is by no means tted to endure. To make this more evident let us examine those miracles related in scripture and not to lose ourselves in too wide a eld let us conne ourselves to such as we nd in the Pentateuch which we shall examine according to the principles of these pretended Christians not as the word or testimony of God himself but as the production of a mere human writer and historian. Here then we are rst to consider a book presented to us by a barbarous and ignorant people written in an age when they were still more barbarous and in all probability long after the facts which it relates corroborated by no concurring testimony and resembling those fabulous accounts which every nation gives of its origin. Upon reading this book we nd it full of prodigies and miracles. It gives an account of a state of the world and of human nature entirely dierent from the present Of our fall from that state Of the age of man extended to near a thousand years Of the destruction of the world by a deluge Of the arbitrary choice of one people as the favourites of heaven and that people the countrymen of the author Of their deliv erance from bondage by prodigies the most astonishing imaginable I desire any one to lay his hand upon his heart and after a serious consideration declare whether he thinks that the falsehood of such a book supported by such a testimony would be more extraordinary and miraculous than all the miracles it relates which is however nec essary to make it be received according to the measures of probability above established. Of Miracles 95 What we have said of miracles may be applied without any variation to prophecies and indeed all prophecies are real miracles and as such only can be admitted as proofs of any revelation. If it did not exceed the capacity of human nature to foretel future events it would be absurd to employ any prophecy as an argument for a divine mission or authority from heaven. So that upon the whole we may conclude that the Christian Religion not only was at rst attended with miracles but even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable person without one. Mere reason is insucient to convince us of its veracity And whoever is moved by Faith to assent to it is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person which subverts all the prin ciples of his understanding and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience. 31 SECTION XI Of a Particular Providence and of a Future State I was lately engaged in conversation with a friend who loves scep tical paradoxes where though he advanced many principles of which I can by no means approve yet as they seem to be curious and to bear some relation to the chain of reasoning carried on throughout this enquiry I shall here copy them from my memory as accurately as I can in order to submit them to the judgment of the reader. Our conversation began with my admiring the singular good fortune of philosophy which as it requires entire liberty above all other privileges and chiey ourishes from the free opposition of sentiments and argumentation received its rst birth in an age and country of freedom and toleration and was never cramped even in its most extravagant principles by any creeds confessions or penal statutes. For except the banishment of Protagoras and the death of Socrates which last event proceeded partly from other motives there are scarcely any instances to be met with in ancient history of this bigotted jealousy with which the present age is so much infested. Epicurus lived at Athens to an advanced age in peace and tranquillity were even admitted to receive the sacerdotal character and to ociate at the altar in the most sacred rites of the established religion And the public of pensions and salaries was aorded equally by the wisest of all the Roman to the professors of every sect of philosophy. How requisite such kind of treatment was to philosophy in her early youth will easily be conceived if we reect that even at present when she may be supposed more hardy and robust she bears with much diculty the inclemency of the seasons and those harsh winds of calumny and persecution which blow upon her. Of a Providence and Future State You admire says my friend as the singular good fortune of philosophy what seems to result from the natural course of things and to be unavoidable in every age and nation. This pertinacious bigotry of which you complain as so fatal to philosophy is really her ospring who after allying with superstition separates himself entirely from the interest of his parent and becomes her most inveterate enemy and persecutor. Speculative dogmas of religion the present occasions of such furious dispute could not possibly be conceived or admitted in the early ages of the world when mankind being wholly illiterate formed an idea of religion more suitable to their weak apprehension and composed their sacred tenets of such tales chiey as were the objects of traditional belief more than of argument or disputation. After the rst alarm therefore was over which arose from the new paradoxes and principles of the philosophers these teachers seem ever after during the ages of antiquity to have lived in great harmony with the established superstition and to have made a fair partition of mankind between them the former claiming all the learned and wise the latter possessing all the vulgar and illiterate. It seems then say I that you leave politics entirely out of the question and never suppose that a wise magistrate can justly be jeal ous of certain tenets of philosophy such as those of Epicurus which denying a divine existence and consequently a providence and a future state seem to loosen in a great measure the ties of morality and may be supposed for that reason pernicious to the peace of civil society. I know replied he that in fact these persecutions never in any age proceeded from calm reason or from experience of the perni cious consequences of philosophy but arose entirely from passion and prejudice. But what if I should advance farther and assert that if Epicurus had been accused before the people by any of the syco phants or informers of those days he could easily have defended his cause and proved his principles of philosophy to be as salutary as those of his adversaries who endeavoured with such zeal to expose him to the public hatred and jealousy I wish said I you would try your eloquence upon so extraor dinary a topic and make a speech for Epicurus which might satisfy not the mob of Athens if you will allow that ancient and polite city to have contained any mob but the more philosophical part of his audience such as might be supposed capable of comprehending his arguments. 7 134 Section XI 98 The matter would not be dicult upon such conditions replied he And if you please I shall suppose myself Epicurus for a moment and make you stand for the Athenian people and shall deliver you such an harangue as will ll all the urn with white beans and leave not a black one to gratify the malice of my adversaries. Very well Pray proceed upon these suppositions. I come hither O ye Athenians to justify in your assembly what I maintained in my school and I nd myself impeached by furi ous antagonists instead of reasoning with calm and dispassionate enquirers. Your deliberations which of right should be directed to questions of public good and the interest of the commonwealth are diverted to the disquisitions of speculative philosophy and these magnicent but perhaps fruitless enquiries take place of your more familiar but more useful occupations. But so far as in me lies I will prevent this abuse. We shall not here dispute concerning the origin and government of worlds. We shall only enquire how far such ques tions concern the public interest. And if I can persuade you that they are entirely indierent to the peace of society and security of govern ment I hope that you will presently send us back to our schools there to examine at leisure the question the most sublime but at the same time the most speculative of all philosophy. The religious philosophers not satised with the tradition of your forefathers and doctrine of your priests in which I willingly acquiesce indulge a rash curiosity in trying how far they can estab lish religion upon the principles of reason and they thereby excite instead of satisfying the doubts which naturally arise from a diligent and scrutinous enquiry. They paint in the most magnicent colours the order beauty and wise arrangement of the universe and then ask if such a glorious display of intelligence could proceed from the fortuitous concourse of atoms or if chance could produce what the greatest genius can never suciently admire. I shall not examine the justness of this argument. I shall allow it to be as solid as my antagonists and accusers can desire. It is sucient if I can prove from this very reasoning that the question is entirely speculative and that when in my philosophical disquisitions I deny a providence and a future state I undermine not the foundations of society but advance principles which they themselves upon their own topics if they argue consistently must allow to be solid and satisfactory. You then who are my accusers have acknowledged that the chief or sole argument for a divine existence which I never questioned 135 Of a Providence and Future State 99 is derived from the order of nature where there appear such marks of intelligence and design that you think it extravagant to assign for its cause either chance or the blind and unguided force of matter. You allow that this is an argument drawn from eects to causes. From the order of the work you infer that there must have been project and forethought in the workman. If you cannot make out this point you allow that your conclusion fails and you pretend not to establish the conclusion in a greater latitude than the phaenomena of nature will justify. These are your concessions. I desire you to mark the consequences. When we infer any particular cause from an eect we must proportion the one to the other and can never be allowed to ascribe to the cause any qualities but what are exactly sucient to produce the eect. A body of ten ounces raised in any scale may serve as a proof that the counterbalancing weight exceeds ten ounces but can never aord a reason that it exceeds a hundred. If the cause assigned for any eect be not sucient to produce it we must either reject that cause or add to it such qualities as will give it a just proportion to the eect. But if we ascribe to it farther qualities or arm it capable of producing other eects we can only indulge the licence of conjec ture and arbitrarily suppose the existence of qualities and energies without reason or authority. The same rule holds whether the cause assigned be brute unconscious matter or a rational intelligent being. If the cause be known only by the eect we never ought to ascribe to it any quali ties beyond what are precisely requisite to produce the eect Nor can we by any rules of just reasoning return back from the cause and infer other eects from it beyond those by which alone it is known to us. No one merely from the sight of one of Zeuxiss pictures could know that he was also a statuary or architect and was an artist no less skilful in stone and marble than in colours. The talents and taste dis played in the particular work before us these we may safely conclude the workman to be possessed of. The cause must be proportioned to the eect and if we exactly and precisely proportion it we shall never nd in it any qualities that point farther or aord an inference concerning any other design or performance. Such qualities must be somewhat beyond what is merely requisite for producing the eect which we examine. Allowing therefore the gods to be the authors of the existence or order of the universe it follows that they possess that precise 136 137 Section XI degree of power intelligence and benevolence which appears in their workmanship but nothing farther can ever be proved except we call in the assistance of exaggeration and attery to supply the defects of argument and reasoning. So far as the traces of any attributes at present appear so far may we conclude these attributes to exist. The supposition of farther attributes is mere hypothesis much more the supposition that in distant regions of space or periods of time there has been or will be a more magnicent display of these attributes and a scheme of administration more suitable to such imaginary virtues. We can never be allowed to mount up from the universe the eect to Jupiter the cause and then descend downwards to infer any new eect from that cause as if the present eects alone were not entirely worthy of the glorious attributes which we ascribe to that deity. The knowledge of the cause being derived solely from the eect they must be exactly adjusted to each other and the one can never refer to any thing farther or be the foundation of any new inference and conclusion. You nd certain phaenomena in nature. You seek a cause or author. You imagine that you have found him. You afterwards become so enamoured of this ospring of your brain that you imagine it impossible but he must produce something greater and more perfect than the present scene of things which is so full of ill and disorder. You forget that this superlative intelligence and benevolence are entirely imaginary or at least without any foundation in reason and that you have no ground to ascribe to him any qualities but what you see he has actually exerted and displayed in his productions. Let your gods therefore O philosophers be suited to the present appearances of nature And presume not to alter these appearances by arbitrary suppositions in order to suit them to the attributes which you so fondly ascribe to your deities. When priests and poets supported by your authority O Athenians talk of a golden or silver age which preceded the pres ent state of vice and misery I hear them with attention and with rev erence. But when philosophers who pretend to neglect authority and to cultivate reason hold the same discourse I pay them not I own the same obsequious submission and pious deference. I ask who carried them into the celestial regions who admitted them into the councils of the gods who opened to them the book of fate that they thus rashly arm that their deities have executed or will execute any purpose 100 138 Of a Providence and Future State beyond what has actually appeared If they tell me that they have mounted on the steps or by the gradual ascent of reason and by drawing inferences from eects to causes I still insist that they have aided the ascent of reason by the wings of imagination otherwise they could not thus change their manner of inference and argue from causes to eects presuming that a more perfect production than the present world would be more suitable to such perfect beings as the gods and forgetting that they have no reason to ascribe to these celestial beings any perfection or any attribute but what can be found in the present world. Hence all the fruitless industry to account for the ill appear ances of nature and save the honour of the gods while we must acknowledge the reality of that evil and disorder with which the world so much abounds. The obstinate and intractable qualities of matter we are told or the observance of general laws or some such reason is the sole cause which controlled the power and benevolence of Jupiter and obliged him to create mankind and every sensible creature so imperfect and so unhappy. These attributes then are it seems beforehand taken for granted in their greatest latitude. And upon that supposition I own that such conjectures may perhaps be admitted as plausible solutions of the ill phaenomena. But still I ask Why take these attributes for granted or why ascribe to the cause any qualities but what actually appear in the eect Why torture your brain to justify the course of nature upon suppositions which for aught you know may be entirely imaginary and of which there are to be found no traces in the course of nature The religious hypothesis therefore must be considered only as a particular method of accounting for the visible phaenomena of the universe But no just reasoner will ever presume to infer from it any single fact and alter or add to the phaenomena in any single particular. If you think that the appearances of things prove such causes it is allowable for you to draw an inference concerning the existence of these causes. In such complicated and sublime subjects every one should be indulged in the liberty of conjecture and argument. But here you ought to rest. If you come backward and arguing from your inferred causes conclude that any other fact has existed or will exist in the course of nature which may serve as a fuller display of particular attributes I must admonish you that you have departed from the method of reasoning attached to the present subject and have 101 139 Section XI certainly added something to the attributes of the cause beyond what appears in the eect otherwise you could never with tolerable sense or propriety add any thing to the eect in order to render it more worthy of the cause. Where then is the odiousness of that doctrine which I teach in my school or rather which I examine in my gardens Or what do you nd in this whole question wherein the security of good morals or the peace and order of society is in the least concerned I deny a providence you say and supreme governour of the world who guides the course of events and punishes the vicious with infamy and disappointment and rewards the virtuous with honour and success in all their undertakings. But surely I deny not the course itself of events which lies open to every ones enquiry and examination. I acknowledge that in the present order of things virtue is attended with more peace of mind than vice and meets with a more favourable reception from the world. I am sensible that according to the past experience of mankind friendship is the chief joy of human life and moderation the only source of tranquillity and happiness. I never balance between the virtuous and the vicious course of life but am sensible that to a well disposed mind every advantage is on the side of the former. And what can you say more allowing all your suppositions and reasonings You tell me indeed that this disposi tion of things proceeds from intelligence and design. But whatever it proceeds from the disposition itself on which depends our happi ness or misery and consequently our conduct and deportment in life is still the same. It is still open for me as well as you to regulate my behaviour by my experience of past events. And if you arm that while a divine providence is allowed and a supreme distributive justice in the universe I ought to expect some more particular reward of the good and punishment of the bad beyond the ordinary course of events I here nd the same fallacy which I have before endeavoured to detect. You persist in imagining that if we grant that divine existence for which you so earnestly contend you may safely infer consequences from it and add something to the experienced order of nature by arguing from the attributes which you ascribe to your gods. You seem not to remember that all your reasonings on this subject can only be drawn from eects to causes and that every argument deduced from causes to eects must of necessity be a gross sophism since it is impossible for you to know 102 140 141 Of a Providence and Future State any thing of the cause but what you have antecedently not inferred but discovered to the full in the eect. But what must a philosopher think of those vain reasoners who instead of regarding the present scene of things as the sole object of their contemplation so far reverse the whole course of nature as to render this life merely a passage to something farther a porch which leads to a greater and vastly dierent building a prologue which serves only to introduce the piece and give it more grace and propriety Whence do you think can such philosophers derive their idea of the gods From their own conceit and imagina tion surely. For if they derived it from the present phaenomena it would never point to any thing farther but must be exactly adjusted to them. That the divinity may possibly be endowed with attributes which we have never seen exerted may be governed by principles of action which we cannot discover to be satised All this will freely be allowed. But still this is mere possibility and hypothesis. We never can have reason to infer any attributes or any principles of action in him but so far as we know them to have been exerted and satised. Are there any marks of a distributive justice in the world If you answer in the armative I conclude that since justice here exerts itself it is satised. If you reply in the negative I conclude that you have then no reason to ascribe justice in our sense of it to the gods. If you hold a medium between armation and negation by saying that the justice of the gods at present exerts itself in part but not in its full extent I answer that you have no reason to give it any particular extent but only so far as you see it at present exert itself. Thus I bring the dispute O Athenians to a short issue with my antagonists. The course of nature lies open to my contem plation as well as to theirs. The experienced train of events is the great standard by which we all regulate our conduct. Nothing else can be appealed to in the eld or in the senate. Nothing else ought ever to be heard of in the school or in the closet. In vain would our limited understanding break through those boundaries which are too narrow for our fond imagination. While we argue from the course of nature and infer a particular intelligent cause which rst bestowed and still preserves order in the universe we embrace a principle which is both uncertain and useless. It is uncertain because the subject lies entirely beyond the reach of human experience. It is useless because our knowledge of this cause being derived entirely from the course of 103 142 Section XI nature we can never according to the rules of just reasoning return back from the cause with any new inference or making additions to the common and experienced course of nature establish any new principles of conduct and behaviour. I observe said I nding he had nished his harangue that you neglect not the artice of the demagogues of old and as you were pleased to make me stand for the people you insinuate yourself into my favour by embracing those principles to which you know I have always expressed a particular attachment. But allowing you to make experience as indeed I think you ought the only standard of our judgment concerning this and all other questions of fact I doubt not but from the very same experience to which you appeal it may be possible to refute this reasoning which you have put into the mouth of Epicurus. If you saw for instance a halfnished build ing surrounded with heaps of brick and stone and mortar and all the instruments of masonry could you not infer from the eect that it was a work of design and contrivance And could you not return again from this inferred cause to infer new additions to the eect and conclude that the building would soon be nished and receive all the further improvements which art could bestow upon it If you saw upon the seashore the print of one human foot you would con clude that a man had passed that way and that he had also left the traces of the other foot though eaced by the rolling of the sands or inundation of the waters. Why then do you refuse to admit the same method of reasoning with regard to the order of nature Consider the world and the present life only as an imperfect building from which you can infer a superior intelligence and arguing from that superior intelligence which can leave nothing imperfect why may you not infer a more nished scheme or plan which will receive its comple tion in some distant point of space or time Are not these methods of reasoning exactly similar And under what pretence can you embrace the one while you reject the other The innite dierence of the subjects replied he is a sucient foundation for this dierence in my conclusions. In works of human art and contrivance it is allowable to advance from the eect to the cause and returning back from the cause to form new inferences concerning the eect and examine the alterations which it has probably undergone or may still undergo. But what is the foundation of this method of reasoning Plainly this that man is a 104 143 Of a Providence and Future State being whom we know by experience whose motives and designs we are acquainted with and whose projects and inclinations have a certain connexion and coherence according to the laws which nature has established for the government of such a creature. When there fore we nd that any work has proceeded from the skill and indus try of man as we are otherwise acquainted with the nature of the animal we can draw a hundred inferences concerning what may be expected from him and these inferences will all be founded in experi ence and observation. But did we know man only from the single work or production which we examine it were impossible for us to argue in this manner because our knowledge of all the qualities which we ascribe to him being in that case derived from the production it is impossible they could point to any thing farther or be the foundation of any new inference. The print of a foot in the sand can only prove when considered alone that there was some gure adapted to it by which it was produced But the print of a human foot proves likewise from our other experience that there was probably another foot which also left its impression though eaced by time or other accidents. Here we mount from the eect to the cause and descending again from the cause infer alterations in the eect but this is not a continuation of the same simple chain of reasoning. We comprehend in this case a hundred other experiences and observations concerning the usual gure and members of that species of animal without which this method of argument must be considered as fallacious and sophistical. The case is not the same with our reasonings from the works of nature. The Deity is known to us only by his productions and is a single being in the universe not comprehended under any species or genus from whose experienced attributes or qualities we can by analogy infer any attribute or quality in him. As the universe shews wisdom and goodness we infer wisdom and goodness. As it shews a particular degree of these perfections we infer a particular degree of them precisely adapted to the eect which we examine. But farther attributes or farther degrees of the same attributes we can never be authorised to infer or suppose by any rules of just reasoning. Now without some such licence of supposition it is impossible for us to argue from the cause or infer any alteration in the eect beyond what has immediately fallen under our observation. Greater good produced by this Being must still prove a greater degree of goodness a more impartial distribution of rewards and punishments must proceed 105 144 145 Section XI 106 from a greater regard to justice and equity. Every supposed addition to the works of nature makes an addition to the attributes of the Author of nature and consequently being entirely unsupported by any reason or argument can never be admitted but as mere conjecture an. The great source of our mistake in this subject and of the unbounded licence of conjecture which we indulge is that we tacitly consider ourselves as in the place of the Supreme Being and conclude that he will on every occasion observe the same conduct which we ourselves in his situation would have embraced as reasonable and eligible. But besides that the ordinary course of nature may convince us that almost every thing is regulated by principles and maxims very dierent from ours besides this I say it must evidently appear contrary to all rules of analogy to reason from the intentions and projects of men to those of a Being so dierent and so much supe rior. In human nature there is a certain experienced coherence of designs and inclinations so that when from any fact we have dis covered one intention of any man it may often be reasonable from experience to infer another and draw a long chain of conclusions concerning his past or future conduct. But this method of reasoning can never have place with regard to a Being so remote and incom prehensible who bears much less analogy to any other being in the universe than the sun to a waxen taper and who discovers himself only by some faint traces or outlines beyond which we have no authority to ascribe to him any attribute or perfection. What we imagine to be a superior perfection may really be a defect. Or were it ever so much a perfection the ascribing of it to the Supreme Being where it appears not to have been really exerted to the full in his works savours more of attery and panegyric than of just reasoning and sound philosophy. All the philosophy therefore in the world and all the religion which is nothing but a species of philosophy will never be able to carry us beyond the usual course of experience or give us measures of conduct and behaviour dierent from those which are furnished by reections on common life. No new fact can ever be inferred from the religious hypothesis no event foreseen or foretold no reward or punishment expected or dreaded beyond what is already known by practice and observation. So that my apology for 146 31 See endnote p. Of a Providence and Future State Epicurus will still appear solid and satisfactory nor have the political interests of society any connexion with the philosophical disputes concerning metaphysics and religion. There is still one circumstance replied I which you seem to have overlooked. Though I should allow your premises I must deny your conclusion. You conclude that religious doctrines and reasonings can have no inuence on life because they ought to have no inuence never considering that men reason not in the same manner you do but draw many consequences from the belief of a divine Existence and suppose that the Deity will inict punishments on vice and bestow rewards on virtue beyond what appear in the ordinary course of nature. Whether this reasoning of theirs be just or not is no matter. Its inuence on their life and conduct must still be the same. And those who attempt to disabuse them of such prejudices may for aught I know be good reasoners but I cannot allow them to be good citizens and politicians since they free men from one restraint upon their pas sions and make the infringement of the laws of society in one respect more easy and secure. After all I may perhaps agree to your general conclusion in favour of liberty though upon dierent premises from those on which you endeavour to found it. I think that the state ought to tolerate every principle of philosophy nor is there an instance that any government has suered in its political interests by such indul gence. There is no enthusiasm among philosophers their doctrines are not very alluring to the people and no restraint can be put upon their reasonings but what must be of dangerous consequence to the sciences and even to the state by paving the way for persecution and oppression in points where the generality of mankind are more deeply interested and concerned. But there occurs to me continued I with regard to your main topic a diculty which I shall just propose to you without insisting on it lest it lead into reasonings of too nice and delicate a nature. In a word I much doubt whether it be possible for a cause to be known only by its eect as you have all along supposed or to be of so singular and particular a nature as to have no parallel and no similarity with any other cause or object that has ever fallen under our observation. It is only when two species of objects are found to be constantly conjoined that we can infer the one from the other and were an eect presented which was entirely singular and could not be comprehended under 107 147 148 Section XI 108 any known species I do not see that we could form any conjecture or inference at all concerning its cause. If experience and observation and analogy be indeed the only guides which we can reasonably follow in inferences of this nature both the eect and cause must bear a similar ity and resemblance to other eects and causes which we know and which we have found in many instances to be conjoined with each other. I leave it to your own reection to pursue the consequences of this principle. I shall just observe that as the antagonists of Epicurus always suppose the universe an eect quite singular and unparalleled to be the proof of a Deity a cause no less singular and unparalleled your reasonings upon that supposition seem at least to merit our attention. There is I own some diculty how we can ever return from the cause to the eect and reasoning from our ideas of the former infer any alteration on the latter or any addition to it. SECTION XII Of the Academical or Sceptical Philosophy PART I T here is not a greater number of philosophical reasonings dis played upon any subject than those which prove the existence of a Deity and refute the fallacies of Atheists and yet the most reli gious philosophers still dispute whether any man can be so blinded as to be a speculative atheist. How shall we reconcile these contradic tions The knightserrant who wandered about to clear the world of dragons and giants never entertained the least doubt with regard to the existence of these monsters. The Sceptic is another enemy of religion who naturally pro vokes the indignation of all divines and graver philosophers though it is certain that no man ever met with any such absurd creature or conversed with a man who had no opinion or principle concerning any subject either of action or speculation. This begets a very natu ral question What is meant by a sceptic And how far it is possible to push these philosophical principles of doubt and uncertainty There is a species of scepticism antecedent to all study and philosophy which is much inculcated by Des Cartes and others as a sovereign preservative against error and precipitate judgment. It recommends an universal doubt not only of all our former opinions and principles but also of our very faculties of whose veracity say they we must assure ourselves by a chain of reasoning deduced from some original principle which cannot possibly be fallacious or deceitful. But neither is there any such original principle which has a prerogative above others that are selfevident and convincing Or if there were could we advance a step beyond it but by the use of those very faculties of which we are supposed to be already dident. The Cartesian doubt there fore were it ever possible to be attained by any human creature as it plainly is not would be entirely incurable and no reasoning could ever bring us to a state of assurance and conviction upon any subject. It must however be confessed that this species of scepticism when more moderate may be understood in a very reasonable sense 149 150 Section XII and is a necessary preparative to the study of philosophy by preserving a proper impartiality in our judgments and weaning our mind from all those prejudices which we may have imbibed from education or rash opinion. To begin with clear and selfevident principles to advance by timorous and sure steps to review frequently our conclusions and examine accurately all their consequences though by these means we shall make both a slow and a short progress in our systems are the only methods by which we can ever hope to reach truth and attain a proper stability and certainty in our determinations. There is another species of scepticism consequent to science and enquiry when men are supposed to have discovered either the absolute fallaciousness of their mental faculties or their untness to reach any xed determination in all those curious subjects of speculation about which they are commonly employed. Even our very senses are brought into dispute by a certain species of philosophers and the maxims of common life are subjected to the same doubt as the most profound principles or conclusions of metaphysics and theology. As these para doxical tenets if they may be called tenets are to be met with in some philosophers and the refutation of them in several they naturally excite our curiosity and make us enquire into the arguments on which they may be founded. I need not insist upon the more trite topics employed by the scep tics in all ages against the evidence of sense such as those which are derived from the imperfection and fallaciousness of our organs on num berless occasions the crooked appearance of an oar in water the various aspects of objects according to their dierent distances the double images which arise from the pressing one eye with many other appear ances of a like nature. These sceptical topics indeed are only sucient to prove that the senses alone are not implicitly to be depended on but that we must correct their evidence by reason and by considerations derived from the nature of the medium the distance of the object and the disposition of the organ in order to render them within their sphere the proper criteria of truth and falsehood. There are other more profound arguments against the senses which admit not of so easy a solution. It seems evident that men are carried by a natural instinct or prepossession to repose faith in their senses and that without any reasoning or even almost before the use of reason we always suppose an external universe which depends not on our perception but would exist though we and every sensible creature were absent or annihilated. 10 151 Academical or Sceptical Philosophy Even the animal creation are governed by a like opinion and preserve this belief of external objects in all their thoughts designs and actions. It seems also evident that when men follow this blind and pow erful instinct of nature they always suppose the very images presented by the senses to be the external objects and never entertain any sus picion that the one are nothing but representations of the other. This very table which we see white and which we feel hard is believed to exist independent of our perception and to be something external to our mind which perceives it. Our presence bestows not being on it Our absence does not annihilate it. It preserves its existence uniform and entire independent of the situation of intelligent beings who perceive or contemplate it. But this universal and primary opinion of all men is soon destroyed by the slightest philosophy which teaches us that nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or perception and that the senses are only the inlets through which these images are conveyed without being able to produce any immediate intercourse between the mind and the object. The table which we see seems to diminish as we remove farther from it But the real table which exists inde pendent of us suers no alteration It was therefore nothing but its image which was present to the mind. These are the obvious dictates of reason and no man who reects ever doubted that the exis tences which we consider when we say this house and that tree are nothing but perceptions in the mind and eeting copies or represen tations of other existences which remain uniform and independent. So far then are we necessitated by reasoning to contradict or depart from the primary instincts of nature and to embrace a new system with regard to the evidence of our senses. But here philosophy nds herself extremely embarrassed when she would justify this new system and obviate the cavils and objections of the sceptics. She can no longer plead the infallible and irresistible instinct of nature For that led us to a quite dierent system which is acknowledged fallible and even erroneous. And to justify this pretended philosophical system by a chain of clear and convincing argument or even any appearance of argument exceeds the power of all human capacity. By what argument can it be proved that the perceptions of the mind must be caused by external objects entirely dierent from them though resembling them if that be possible and could not arise either from the energy of the mind itself or from the suggestion of some 111 152 153 Section XII 112 invisible and unknown spirit or from some other cause still more unknown to us It is acknowledged that in fact many of these percep tions arise not from any thing external as in dreams madness and other diseases. And nothing can be more inexplicable than the manner in which body should so operate upon mind as ever to convey an image of itself to a substance supposed of so dierent and even contrary a nature. It is a question of fact whether the perceptions of the senses be produced by external objects resembling them How shall this ques tion be determined By experience surely as all other questions of a like nature. But here experience is and must be entirely silent. The mind has never any thing present to it but the perceptions and cannot pos sibly reach any experience of their connexion with objects. The sup position of such a connexion is therefore without any foundation in reasoning. To have recourse to the veracity of the supreme Being in order to prove the veracity of our senses is surely making a very unex pected circuit. If his veracity were at all concerned in this matter our senses would be entirely infallible because it is not possible that he can ever deceive. Not to mention that if the external world be once called in question we shall be at a loss to nd arguments by which we may prove the existence of that Being or any of his attributes. This is a topic therefore in which the profounder and more philosophical sceptics will always triumph when they endeavour to introduce an universal doubt into all subjects of human knowledge and enquiry. Do you follow the instincts and propensities of nature may they say in assenting to the veracity of sense But these lead you to believe that the very perception or sensible image is the external object. Do you disclaim this principle in order to embrace a more rational opinion that the perceptions are only representations of some thing external You here depart from your natural propensities and more obvious sentiments and yet are not able to satisfy your reason which can never nd any convincing argument from experience to prove that the perceptions are connected with any external objects. There is another sceptical topic of a like nature derived from the most profound philosophy which might merit our attention were it requisite to dive so deep in order to discover arguments and reason ings which can so little serve to any serious purpose. It is universally allowed by modern enquirers that all the sensible qualities of objects such as hard soft hot cold white black c. If this be allowed with regard to secondary qualities it must also follow with regard to the supposed primary qualities of extension and solid ity nor can the latter be any more entitled to that denomination than the former. The idea of extension is entirely acquired from the senses of sight and feeling and if all the qualities perceived by the senses be in the mind not in the object the same conclusion must reach the idea of extension which is wholly dependent on the sensible ideas or the ideas of secondary qualities. Nothing can save us from this con clusion but the asserting that the ideas of those primary qualities are attained by Abstraction an opinion which if we examine it accurately we shall nd to be unintelligible and even absurd. An extension that is neither tangible nor visible cannot possibly be conceived And a tangible or visible extension which is neither hard nor soft black nor white is equally beyond the reach of human conception. Let any man try to con ceive a triangle in general which is neither Isoceles nor Scalenum nor has any particular length or proportion of sides and he will soon perceive the absurdity of all the scholastic notions with regard to abstraction and genera. Thus the rst philosophical objection to the evidence of sense or to the opinion of external existence consists in this that such an opinion if rested on natural instinct is contrary to reason and if referred to reason is contrary to natural instinct and at the same time carries no rational evidence with it to convince an impartial enquirer. The second objection goes farther and represents this opinion as con trary to reason at least if it be a principle of reason that all sensible qualities are in the mind not in the object. Bereave matter of all its intelligible qualities both primary and secondary you in a manner annihilate it and leave only a certain unknown inexplicable something as the cause of our perceptions a notion so imperfect that no sceptic will think it worth while to contend against it. PART II It may seem a very extravagant attempt of the sceptics to destroy reason by argument and ratiocination yet is this the grand scope of all 155 32 See endnote p. Section XII 114 their enquiries and disputes. They endeavour to nd objections both to our abstract reasonings and to those which regard matter of fact and existence. The chief objection against all abstract reasonings is derived from the ideas of space and time ideas which in common life and to a care less view are very clear and intelligible but when they pass through the scrutiny of the profound sciences and they are the chief object of these sciences aord principles which seem full of absurdity and contradic tion. No priestly dogmas invented on purpose to tame and subdue the rebellious reason of mankind ever shocked common sense more than the doctrine of the innite divisibility of extension with its consequences as they are pompously displayed by all geometricians and metaphysi cians with a kind of triumph and exultation. A real quantity innitely less than any nite quantity containing quantities innitely less than itself and so on in innitum this is an edice so bold and prodigious that it is too weighty for any pretended demonstration to support because it shocks the clearest and most natural principles of huma. But what renders the matter more extraordinary is that these seemingly absurd opinions are supported by a chain of reasoning the clearest and most natural nor is it possible for us to allow the premises without admitting the consequences. Nothing can be more convincing and satisfactory than all the conclusions concerning the properties of circles and triangles and yet when these are once received how can we deny that the angle of contact between a circle and its tangent is innitely less than any rectilineal angle that as you may encrease the diameter of the circle in innitum this angle of contact becomes still less even in innitum and that the angle of contact between other curves and their tangents may be innitely less than those between any circle and its tangent and so on in innitum The demonstration of these principles seems as unexceptionable as that which proves the three angles of a triangle to be equal to two right ones though the latter opinion be natural and easy and the former big with contradiction and absurdity. Reason here seems to be thrown into a kind of amazement and suspence which without the suggestions of any sceptic gives her a didence of herself and of the ground on which she treads. She sees a full light which illuminates certain places but that light borders upon the most profound darkness. And between these she is so dazzled and 156 157 33 See endnote p. Academical or Sceptical Philosophy 115 confounded that she scarcely can pronounce with certainty and assur ance concerning any one object. The absurdity of these bold determinations of the abstract sciences seems to become if possible still more palpable with regard to time than extension. An innite number of real parts of time pass ing in succession and exhausted one after another appears so evident a contradiction that no man one should think whose judgment is not corrupted instead of being improved by the sciences would ever be able to admit of it. Yet still reason must remain restless and unquiet even with regard to that scepticism to which she is driven by these seeming absurdities and contradictions. How any clear distinct idea can con tain circumstances contradictory to itself or to any other clear dis tinct idea is absolutely incomprehensible and is perhaps as absurd as any proposition which can be formed. So that nothing can be more sceptical or more full of doubt and hesitation than this scep ticism itself which arises from some of the paradoxical conclusions of geometry or the science o. The sceptical objections to moral evidence or to the reason ings concerning matter of fact are either popular or philosophical. The popular objections are derived from the natural weakness of human understanding the contradictory opinions which have been entertained in dierent ages and nations the variations of our judgment in sick ness and health youth and old age prosperity and adversity the per petual contradiction of each particular mans opinions and sentiments with many other topics of that kind. It is needless to insist farther on this head. These objections are but weak. For as in common life we reason every moment concerning fact and existence and cannot pos sibly subsist without continually employing this species of argument any popular objections derived from thence must be insucient to destroy that evidence. The great subverter of Pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of scepticism is action and employment and the occupations of common life. These principles may ourish and tri umph in the schools where it is indeed dicult if not impossible to refute them. But as soon as they leave the shade and by the pres ence of the real objects which actuate our passions and sentiments are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature 158 159 34 See endnote p. Section XII they vanish like smoke and leave the most determined sceptic in the same condition as other mortals. The sceptic therefore had better keep within his proper sphere and display those philosophical objections which arise from more profound researches. Here he seems to have ample matter of triumph while he justly insists that all our evidence for any matter of fact which lies beyond the testimony of sense or memory is derived entirely from the relation of cause and eect that we have no other idea of this relation than that of two objects which have been frequently conjoined together that we have no argument to convince us that objects which have in our experience been frequently con joined will likewise in other instances be conjoined in the same manner and that nothing leads us to this inference but custom or a certain instinct of our nature which it is indeed dicult to resist but which like other instincts may be fallacious and deceitful. While the sceptic insists upon these topics he shews his force or rather indeed his own and our weakness and seems for the time at least to destroy all assurance and conviction. These arguments might be displayed at greater length if any durable good or benet to society could ever be expected to result from them. For here is the chief and most confounding objection to excessive scepticism that no durable good can ever result from it while it remains in its full force and vigour. We need only ask such a sceptic What his meaning is And what he proposes by all these curious researches He is immediately at a loss and knows not what to answer. A Copernican or Ptolemaic who supports each his dierent system of astron omy may hope to produce a conviction which will remain constant and durable with his audience. A Stoic or Epicurean displays principles which may not only be durable but which have an eect on conduct and behaviour. But a Pyrrhonian cannot expect that his philosophy will have any constant inuence on the mind Or if it had that its inuence would be benecial to society. On the contrary he must acknowledge if he will acknowledge any thing that all human life must perish were his principles universally and steadily to prevail. All discourse all action would immediately cease and men remain in a total lethargy till the necessities of nature unsatised put an end to their miserable existence. It is true so fatal an event is very little to be dreaded. Nature is always too strong for principle. And though a Pyrrhonian may throw himself or others into a momentary 116 160 amazement and confusion by his profound reasonings the rst and most trivial event in life will put to ight all his doubts and scruples and leave him the same in every point of action and speculation with the philosophers of every other sect or with those who never concerned themselves in any philosophical researches. When he awakes from his dream he will be the rst to join in the laugh against himself and to confess that all his objections are mere amusement and can have no other tendency than to show the whimsical condition of mankind who must act and reason and believe though they are not able by their most diligent enquiry to satisfy themselves concerning the foundation of these operations or to remove the objections which may be raised against them. PART III There is indeed a more mitigated scepticism or academical philosophy which may be both durable and useful and which may in part be the result of this Pyrrhonism or excessive scepticism when its undistinguished doubts are in some measure corrected by common sense and reection. The greater part of mankind are natu rally apt to be armative and dogmatical in their opinions and while they see objects only on one side and have no idea of any counterpois ing argument they throw themselves precipitately into the principles to which they are inclined nor have they any indulgence for those who entertain opposite sentiments. To hesitate or balance perplexes their understanding checks their passion and suspends their action. They are therefore impatient till they escape from a state which to them is so uneasy and they think that they can never remove themselves far enough from it by the violence of their armations and obstinacy of their belief. But could such dogmatical reasoners become sensible of the strange inrmities of human understanding even in its most perfect state and when most accurate and cautious in its determinations such a reection would naturally inspire them with more modesty and reserve and diminish their fond opinion of themselves and their prejudice against antagonists. The illiterate may reect on the dispo sition of the learned who amidst all the advantages of study and reection are commonly still dident in their determinations And if any of the learned be inclined from their natural temper to haugh tiness and obstinacy a small tincture of Pyrrhonism might abate Academical or Sceptical Philosophy 117 161 Section XII their pride by shewing them that the few advantages which they may have attained over their fellows are but inconsiderable if compared with the universal perplexity and confusion which is inherent in human nature. In general there is a degree of doubt and caution and modesty which in all kinds of scrutiny and decision ought for ever to accompany a just reasoner. Another species of mitigated scepticism which may be of advantage to mankind and which may be the natural result of the Pyrrhonian doubts and scruples is the limitation of our enquiries to such subjects as are best adapted to the narrow capacity of human understanding. The imagination of man is naturally sublime delighted with whatever is remote and extraordinary and running without controul into the most distant parts of space and time in order to avoid the objects which custom has rendered too familiar to it. A correct Judgment observes a contrary method and avoiding all distant and high enquiries connes itself to common life and to such subjects as fall under daily practice and experience leaving the more sublime topics to the embellishment of poets and orators or to the arts of priests and politicians. To bring us to so salutary a determination nothing can be more serviceable than to be once thoroughly convinced of the force of the Pyrrhonian doubt and of the impossibility that any thing but the strong power of natural instinct could free us from it. Those who have a propensity to philosophy will still continue their researches because they reect that besides the immediate plea sure attending such an occupation philosophical decisions are noth ing but the reections of common life methodized and corrected. But they will never be tempted to go beyond common life so long as they consider the imperfection of those faculties which they employ their narrow reach and their inaccurate operations. While we cannot give a satisfactory reason why we believe after a thousand experiments that a stone will fall or re burn can we ever satisfy ourselves concerning any determination which we may form with regard to the origin of worlds and the situation of nature from and to eternity This narrow limitation indeed of our enquiries is in every respect so reasonable that it suces to make the slightest examination into the natural powers of the human mind and to compare them with their objects in order to recommend it to us. We shall then nd what are the proper subjects of science and enquiry. 18 162 163 It seems to me that the only objects of the abstract sciences or of demonstration are quantity and number and that all attempts to extend this more perfect species of knowledge beyond these bounds are mere sophistry and illusion. As the component parts of quantity and number are entirely similar their relations become intricate and involved and nothing can be more curious as well as useful than to trace by a variety of mediums their equality or inequality through their dierent appearances. But as all other ideas are clearly distinct and dierent from each other we can never advance farther by our outmost scrutiny than to observe this diversity and by an obvious reection pronounce one thing not to be another. Or if there be any diculty in these decisions it proceeds entirely from the undetermi nate meaning of words which is corrected by juster denitions. That the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the squares of the other two sides cannot be known let the terms be ever so exactly dened without a train of reasoning and enquiry. But to convince us of this proposition that where there is no property there can be no injustice it is only necessary to dene the terms and explain injustice to be a violation of property. This proposition is indeed nothing but a more imperfect denition. It is the same case with all those pretended syllogistical reasonings which may be found in every other branch of learning except the sci ences of quantity and number and these may safely I think be pro nounced the only proper objects of knowledge and demonstration. All other enquiries of men regard only matter of fact and exis tence and these are evidently incapable of demonstration. Whatever is may not be. No negation of a fact can involve a contradiction. The nonexistence of any being without exception is as clear and distinct an idea as its existence. The proposition which arms it not to be however false is no less conceivable and intelligible than that which arms it to be. The case is dierent with the sciences properly so called. Every proposition which is not true is there confused and unintelligi ble. That the cube root of 64 is equal to the half of 10 is a false propo sition and can never be distinctly conceived. But that Caesar or the angel Gabriel or any being never existed may be a false proposi tion but still is perfectly conceivable and implies no contradiction. The existence therefore of any being can only be proved by arguments from its cause or its eect and these arguments are founded entirely on experience. If we reason priori any thing may appear able to produce any thing. The falling of a pebble may for Academical or Sceptical Philosophy 119 164 Section XII 120 ought we know extinguish the sun or the wish of a man controul the planets in their orbits. It is only experience which teaches us the nature and bounds of cause and eect and enables us to infer the exis tence of one object from that o. Such is the foundation of moral reasoning which forms the greater part of human knowledge and is the source of all human action and behaviour. Moral reasonings are either concerning particular or general facts. All deliberations in life regard the former as also all disquisi tions in history chronology geography and astronomy. The sciences which treat of general facts are politics natural philosophy physic chymistry c. Divinity or Theology as it proves the existence of a Deity and the immortality of souls is composed partly of reasonings con cerning particular partly concerning general facts. It has a founda tion in reason so far as it is supported by experience. But its best and most solid foundation is faith and divine revelation. Morals and criticism are not so properly objects of the under standing as of taste and sentiment. Beauty whether moral or natural is felt more properly than perceived. Or if we reason concerning it and endeavour to x its standard we regard a new fact to wit the general taste of mankind or some such fact which may be the object of reasoning and enquiry. When we run over libraries persuaded of these principles what havoc must we make If we take in our hand any volume of divin ity or school metaphysics for instance let us ask Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence No. Commit it then to the ames For it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. 65 35 See endnote p. HUMES ENDNOTES For the editorial principles applied here please see the Note on the Text above. Endnote to 2.9 p. 51 I t is probable that no more was meant by those who denied innate ideas than that all ideas were copies of our impressions though it must be confessed that the terms which they employed were not chosen with such caution nor so exactly dened as to prevent all mistakes about their doctrine. For what is meant by innate If innate be equivalent to natural then all the perceptions and ideas of the mind must be allowed to be innate or natural in whatever sense we take the latter word whether in opposition to what is uncommon articial or miraculous. If by innate be meant cotemporary to our birth the dispute seems to be frivolous nor is it worth while to enquire at what time thinking begins whether before at or after our birth. Again the word idea seems to be commonly taken in a very loose sense by Locke and others as standing for any of our percep tions our sensations and passions as well as thoughts. Now in this sense I should desire to know what can be meant by asserting that selflove or resentment of injuries or the passion between the sexes is not innate But admitting these terms impressions and ideas in the sense above explained and understanding by innate what is original or copied from no precedent perception then may we assert that all our impressions are innate and our ideas not innate. To be ingenuous I must own it to be my opinion that Locke was betrayed into this question by the schoolmen who making use of undened terms draw out their disputes to a tedious length without ever touching the point in question. A like ambiguity and circumlocution seem to run through that philosophers reasonings on this as well as most other subjects. Endnote to 5.5 p. 28 N othing is more usual than for writers even on moral political or physical subjects to distinguish between reason and experience and to suppose that these species of argumentation are entirely dierent from each other. The former are taken for the mere result of our intellectual faculties which by considering priori the nature of things and examining the eects that must follow from their operation establish particular prin ciples of science and philosophy. The latter are supposed to be derived entirely from sense and observation by which we learn what has actually resulted from the operation of particular objects and are thence able to 22 43 44 infer what will for the future result from them. Thus for instance the limitations and restraints of civil government and a legal constitution may be defended either from reason which reecting on the great frailty and corruption of human nature teaches that no man can safely be trusted with unlimited authority or from experience and history which inform us of the enormous abuses that ambition in every age and coun try has been found to make of so imprudent a condence. The same distinction between reason and experience is maintained in all our deliberations concerning the conduct of life while the experienced statesman general physician or merchant is trusted and followed and the unpractised novice with whatever natural talents endowed neglected and despised. Though it be allowed that reason may form very plausible conjectures with regard to the consequences of such a particular conduct in such particular circumstances it is still supposed imperfect without the assistance of experience which is alone able to give stability and certainty to the maxims derived from study and reection. But notwithstanding that this distinction be thus universally received both in the active speculative scenes of life I shall not scruple to pronounce that it is at bottom erroneous at least supercial. If we examine those arguments which in any of the sciences above mentioned are supposed to be the mere eects of reasoning and reection they will be found to terminate at last in some general principle or conclusion for which we can assign no reason but observation and experi ence. The only dierence between them and those maxims which are vulgarly esteemed the result of pure experience is that the former cannot be established without some process of thought and some reection on what we have observed in order to distinguish its circumstances and trace its consequences Whereas in the latter the experienced event is exactly and fully similar to that which we infer as the result of any particular situation. The history of a Tiberius or a Nero makes us dread a like tyranny were our monarchs freed from the restraints of laws and senates But the observation of any fraud or cruelty in private life is sucient with the aid of a little thought to give us the same apprehension while it serves as an instance of the general corruption of human nature and shews us the danger which we must incur by reposing an entire condence in mankind. In both cases it is experience which is ultimately the foundation of our inference and conclusion. There is no man so young and unexperienced as not to have formed from observation many general and just maxims concerning human aairs and the conduct of life but it must be confessed that when a man comes to put these in practice he will be extremely liable to error till time and farther experience both enlarge these maxims and teach him their proper use and Application. In every situation or incident there are many particular Humes Endnotes 122 45 and seemingly minute circumstances which the man of greatest talents is at rst apt to overlook though on them the justness of his conclusions and consequently the prudence of his conduct entirely depend. Not to mention that to a young beginner the general observations and maxims occur not always on the proper occasions nor can be immediately applied with due calmness and distinction. The truth is an unexperienced rea soner could be no reasoner at all were he absolutely unexperienced and when we assign that character to any one we mean it only in a comparative sense and suppose him possessed of experience in a smaller and more imperfect degree. Endnote to 7.15 p. I t may be pretended that the resistance which we meet with in bodies obliging us frequently to exert our force and call up all our power this gives us the idea of force and power. It is this nisus or strong endeavour of which we are conscious that is the original impression from which this idea is copied. But rst we attribute power to a vast number of objects where we never can suppose this resistance or exertion of force to take place to the Supreme Being who never meets with any resistance to the mind in its command over its ideas and limbs in common thinking and motion where the eect follows immediately upon the will without any exertion or summoning up of force to inanimate matter which is not capable of this sentiment. Secondly This sentiment of an endeavour to overcome resistance has no known connexion with any event What fol lows it we know by experience but could not know it priori. It must however be confessed that the animal nisus which we experience though it can aord no accurate precise idea of power enters very much into that vulgar inaccurate idea which is formed of it. Endnote to 7.25 p. I need not examine at length the vis inertiae which is so much talked of in the new philosophy and which is ascribed to matter. We nd by experience that a body at rest or in motion continues for ever in its present state till put from it by some new cause and that a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as it acquires itself. These are facts. When we call this a vis inertiae we only mark these facts without pretending to have any idea of the inert power in the same manner as when we talk of gravity we mean certain eects without comprehending that active power. It was never the meaning of Sir Isaac Newton to rob second causes of all force or energy though some of his followers have endeavoured to establish that theory upon his authority. On the contrary that great philosopher had recourse to an etherial active uid to explain his universal attraction though he was so cautious and modest as to allow Humes Endnotes 123 67 73 that it was a mere hypothesis not to be insisted on without more experi ments. I must confess that there is something in the fate of opinions a little extraordinary. Des Cartes insinuated that doctrine of the universal and sole ecacy of the Deity without insisting on it. Malebranche and other Cartesians made it the foundation of all their philosophy. It had however no authority in England. Locke Clarke and Cudworth never so much as take notice of it but suppose all along that matter has a real though subordinate and derived power. By what means has it become so prevalent among our modern metaphysicians Endnote to 7.29 p. A ccording to these explications and denitions the idea of power is relative as much as that of cause and both have a reference to an eect or some other event constantly conjoined with the former. When we consider the unknown circumstance of an object by which the degree or quantity of its eect is xed and determined we call that its power And accordingly it is allowed by all philosophers that the eect is the measure of the power. But if they had any idea of power as it is in itself why could not they measure it in itself The dispute whether the force of a body in motion be as its velocity or the square of its velocity this dispute I say needed not be decided by comparing its eects in equal or unequal times but by a direct mensuration and comparison. As to the frequent use of the words Force Power Energy c. These words as commonly used have very loose meanings annexed to them and their ideas are very uncertain and con fused. No animal can put external bodies in motion without the sentiment of a nisus or endeavour and every animal has a sentiment or feeling from the stroke or blow of an external object that is in motion. These sensations which are merely animal and from which we can priori draw no inference we are apt to transfer to inanimate objects and to suppose that they have some such feelings whenever they transfer or receive motion. With regard to energies which are exerted without our annexing to them any idea of communicated motion we consider only the constant experienced con junction of the events and as we feel a customary connexion between the ideas we transfer that feeling to the objects as nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation which they occasion. Endnote to 8.22 p. T he prevalence of the doctrine of liberty may be accounted for from another cause viz. The necessity of any action whether of matter or of mind is not properly speaking a quality in the agent but in any thinking or intelligent being who may consider the action and it consists chiey in the determination of his thoughts to infer the existence of that action from some preceding objects as liberty when opposed to necessity is nothing but the want of that determination and a certain looseness or indierence which we feel in passing or not passing from the idea of one object to that of any succeeding one. Now we may observe that though in reecting on human actions we seldom feel such a looseness or indierence but are commonly able to infer them with considerable certainty from their motives and from the dispositions of the agent yet it frequently happens that in performing the actions themselves we are sensible of something like it And as all resembling objects are readily taken for each other this has been employed as a demonstrative and even intuitive proof of human liberty. We feel that our actions are subject to our will on most occasions and imagine we feel that the will itself is subject to nothing because when by a denial of it we are provoked to try we feel that it moves easily every way and produces an image of itself or a Vellety as it is called in the schools even on that side on which it did not settle. This image or faint motion we persuade ourselves could at that time have been compleated into the thing itself because should that be denied we nd upon a second trial that at present it can. We consider not that the fantastical desire of shew ing liberty is here the motive of our actions. And it seems certain that however we may imagine we feel a liberty within ourselves a spectator can commonly infer our actions from our motives and character and even where he cannot he concludes in general that he might were he perfectly acquainted with every circumstance of our situation and temper and the most secret springs of our complexion and disposition. Now this is the very essence of necessity according to the foregoing doctrine. Endnote to 8.25 p. T hus if a cause be dened that which produces any thing it is easy to observe that producing is synonimous to causing. In like manner if a cause be dened that by which any thing exists this is liable to the same objection. For what is meant by these words by which Had it been said that a cause is that after which any thing constantly exists we should have understood the terms. For this is indeed all we know of the matter. And this constancy forms the very essence of necessity nor have we any other idea of it. Endnote to 9.5 p. S ince all reasoning concerning facts or causes is derived merely from custom it may be asked how it happens that men so much surpass Humes Endnotes 125 96 107 animals in reasoning and one man so much surpasses another Has not the same custom the same inuence on all We shall here endeavour briey to explain the great dierence in human understandings After which the reason of the dierence between men and animals will easily be comprehended. When we have lived any time and have been accustomed to the uni formity of nature we acquire a general habit by which we always transfer the known to the unknown and conceive the latter to resemble the former. By means of this general habitual principle we regard even one experi ment as the foundation of reasoning and expect a similar event with some degree of certainty where the experiment has been made accurately and free from all foreign circumstances. It is therefore considered as a matter of great importance to observe the consequences of things and as one man may very much surpass another in attention and memory and observation this will make a very great dierence in their reasoning. Where there is a complication of causes to produce any eect one mind may be much larger than another and better able to comprehend the whole system of objects and to infer justly their consequences. One man is able to carry on a chain of consequences to a greater length than another. Few men can think long without running into a confusion of ideas and mistaking one for another and there are various degrees of this inrmity. The circumstance on which the eect depends is frequently involved in other circumstances which are foreign and extrinsic. The sep aration of it often requires great attention accuracy and subtilty. The forming of general maxims from particular observation is a very nice operation and nothing is more usual from haste or a narrowness of mind which sees not on all sides than to commit mistakes in this particular. When we reason from analogies the man who has the greater experi ence or the greater promptitude of suggesting analogies will be the better reasoner. Byasses from prejudice education passion party c. After we have acquired a condence in human testimony books and conversation enlarge much more the sphere of one mans experience and thought than those of another. It would be easy to discover many other circumstances that make a dierence in the understandings of men. Humes Endnotes 126 Endnote to 10.10 p. N o Indian it is evident could have experience that water did not freeze in cold climates. This is placing nature in a situation quite unknown to him and it is impossible for him to tell priori what will result from it. It is making a new experiment the consequence of which is always uncertain. One may sometimes conjecture from analogy what will follow but still this is but conjecture. And it must be confessed that in the pres ent case of freezing the event follows contrary to the rules of analogy and is such as a rational Indian would not look for. The operations of cold upon water are not gradual according to the degrees of cold but whenever it comes to the freezing point the water passes in a moment from the utmost liquidity to perfect hardness. Such an event therefore may be denominated extraordinary and requires a pretty strong testimony to render it credible to people in a warm climate But still it is not miraculous nor contrary to uniform experience of the course of nature in cases where all the circumstances are the same. The inhabitants of Sumatra have always seen water uid in their own climate and the freezing of their rivers ought to be deemed a prodigy But they never saw water in Muscovy during the winter and therefore they cannot reasonably be positive what would there be the consequence. Endnote to 10.12 p. S ometimes an event may not in itself seem to be contrary to the laws of nature and yet if it were real it might by reason of some circum stances be denominated a miracle because in fact it is contrary to these laws. Thus if a person claiming a divine authority should command a sick person to be well a healthful man to fall down dead the clouds to pour rain the winds to blow in short should order many natural events which immediately follow upon his command these might justly be esteemed miracles because they are really in this case contrary to the laws of nature. For if any suspicion remain that the event and command concurred by accident there is no miracle and no transgression of the laws of nature. If this suspicion be removed there is evidently a miracle and a transgression of these laws because nothing can be more contrary to nature than that the voice or command of a man should have such an inuence. A miracle may be accurately dened a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity or by the interposition of some invisible agent. A miracle may either be discoverable by men or not. This alters not its nature and essence. The raising of a house or ship into the air is a visible miracle. The raising of a feather when the wind wants ever so little of a force requisite for that pur pose is as real a miracle though not so sensible with regard to us. Humes Endnotes 127 114 115 Endnote to 10.27 p. T his book was writ by Mons. Montgeron counsellor or judge of the parliament of Paris a man of gure and character who was also a martyr to the cause and is now said to be somewhere in a dungeon on account of his book. There is another book in three volumes called Recueil des Miracles de lAbb Paris giving an account of many of these miracles and accompa nied with prefatory discourses which are very well written. There runs however through the whole of these a ridiculous comparison between the miracles of our Saviour and those of the Abb wherein it is asserted that the evidence for the latter is equal to that for the former As if the testimony of men could ever be put in the balance with that of God himself who conducted the pen of the inspired writers. If these writers indeed were to be considered merely as human testimony the French author is very moderate in his comparison since he might with some appearance of reason pretend that the Jansenist miracles much surpass the other in evidence and authority. The following circumstances are drawn from authentic papers inserted in the abovementioned book. Many of the miracles of Abb Paris were proved immediately by witnesses before the ociality or bishops court at Paris under the eye of cardinal Noailles whose character for integrity and capacity was never contested even by his enemies. His successor in the archbishopric was an enemy to the Jansenists and for that reason promoted to the see by the court. Yet 22 rectors or cures of Paris with innite earnestness press him to examine those miracles which they assert to be known to the whole world and undisputably certain But he wisely forbore. The Molinist party had tried to discredit these miracles in one instance that of Madamoiselle le Franc. But besides that their proceed ings were in many respects the most irregular in the world particularly in citing only a few of the Jansenist witnesses whom they tampered with Besides this I say they soon found themselves overwhelmed by a cloud of new witnesses one hundred and twenty in number most of them persons of credit and substance in Paris who gave oath for the miracle. This was accompanied with a solemn and earnest appeal to the parliament. But the parliament were forbidden by authority to meddle in the aair. It was at last observed that where men are heated by zeal and enthusiasm there is no degree of human testimony so strong as may not be procured for the greatest absurdity And those who will be so silly as to examine the aair by that medium and seek particular aws in the testimony are almost sure to be confounded. It must be a miserable imposture indeed that does not prevail in that contest. Humes Endnotes 128 344 345 All who have been in France about that time have heard of the reputa tion of Mons. Heraut the lieutenant de Police whose vigilance penetration activity and extensive intelligence have been much talked of. This magis trate who by the nature of his oce is almost absolute was invested with full powers on purpose to suppress or discredit these miracles and he frequently seized immediately and examined the witnesses and subjects of them But never could reach any thing satisfactory against them. In the case of Madamoiselle Thibaut he sent the famous De Sylva to examine her whose evidence is very curious. The physician declares that it was impossible she could have been so ill as was proved by witnesses because it was impossible she could in so short a time have recovered so perfectly as he found her. He reasoned like a man of sense from natural causes but the opposite party told him that the whole was a miracle and that his evidence was the very best proof of it. The Molinists were in a sad dilemma. They durst not assert the absolute insuciency of human evidence to prove a miracle. They were obliged to say that these miracles were wrought by witchcraft and the devil. But they were told that this was the resource of the Jews of old. No Jansenist was ever embarrassed to account for the cessation of the miracles when the churchyard was shut up by the kings edict. It was the touch of the tomb which produced these extraordinary eects and when no one could approach the tomb no eects could be expected. God indeed could have thrown down the walls in a moment but he is master of his own graces and works and it belongs not to us to account for them. He did not throw down the walls of every city like those of Jericho on the sounding of the rams horns nor break up the prison of every apostle like that of St. No less a man than the Duc de Chatillon a duke and peer of France of the highest rank and family gives evidence of a miraculous cure performed upon a servant of his who had lived several years in his house with a visible and palpable inrmity. I shall conclude with observing that no clergy are more celebrated for strictness of life and manners than the secular clergy of France particularly the rectors or curs of Paris who bear testimony to these impostures. The learning genius and probity of the gentlemen and the austerity of the nuns of PortRoyal have been much celebrated all over Europe. Yet they all give evidence for a miracle wrought on the niece of the famous Pascal whose sanctity of life as well as extraordinary capacity is well known. The famous Racine gives an account of this miracle in his famous history of Port Royal and forties it with all the proofs which a multitude of nuns priests physicians and men of the world all of them of undoubted credit could bestow upon it. Several men of letters particularly the bishop of Tournay thought this miracle so certain as to employ it in Humes Endnotes 129 346 the refutation of atheists and freethinkers. The queenregent of France who was extremely prejudiced against the PortRoyal sent her own physician to examine the miracle who returned an absolute convert. In short the supernatural cure was so uncontestable that it saved for a time that famous monastery from the ruin with which it was threatened by the Jesuits. Had it been a cheat it had certainly been detected by such sagacious and powerful antagonists and must have hastened the ruin of the contrivers. Our divines who can build up a formidable castle from such despicable materials what a prodigious fabric could they have reared from these and many other circumstances which I have not mentioned How often would the great names of Pascal Racine Arnaud Nicole have resounded in our ears But if they be wise they had better adopt the miracle as being more worth a thousand times than all the rest of their collection. Besides it may serve very much to their purpose. For that miracle was really per formed by the touch of an authentic holy prickle of the holy thorn which composed the holy crown which c. Endnote to 11.26 p. I n general it may I think be established as a maxim that where any cause is known only by its particular eects it must be impossible to infer any new eects from that cause since the qualities which are requisite to produce these new eects along with the former must either be dierent or superior or of more extensive operation than those which simply produced the eect whence alone the cause is supposed to be known to us. We can never therefore have any reason to suppose the exist ence of these qualities. To say that the new eects proceed only from a continuation of the same energy which is already known from the rst eects will not remove the diculty. For even granting this to be the case which can seldom be supposed the very continuation and exertion of a like energy for it is impossible it can be absolutely the same I say this exertion of a like energy in a dierent period of space and time is a very arbitrary supposition and what there cannot possibly be any traces of in the eects from which all our knowledge of the cause is originally derived. Let the inferred cause be exactly proportioned as it should be to the known eect and it is impossible that it can possess any qualities from which new or dierent eects can be inferred. Endnote to 12.15 p. T his argument is drawn from Dr. Berkley and indeed most of the writings of that very ingenious author form the best lessons of scepti cism which are to be found either among the ancient or modern philo sophers Bayle not excepted. He professes however in his titlepage and undoubtedly with great truth to have composed his book against the Humes Endnotes 130 145 155 sceptics as well as against the atheists and freethinkers. But that all his arguments though otherwise intended are in reality merely sceptical appears from this that they admit of no answer and produce no conviction. Their only eect is to cause that momentary amazement and irresolution and confusion which is the result of scepticism. Endnote to 12.18 p. W hatever disputes there may be about mathematical points we must allow that there are physical points that is parts of extension which cannot be divided or lessened either by the eye or imagination. These images then which are present to the fancy or senses are absolutely indi visible and consequently must be allowed by mathematicians to be innitely less than any real part of extension and yet nothing appears more certain to reason than that an innite number of them composes an innite exten sion. How much more an innite number of those innitely small parts of extension which are still supposed innitely divisible. Endnote to 12.20 p. I t seems to me not impossible to avoid these absurdities and contradic tions if it be admitted that there is no such thing as abstract or general ideas properly speaking but that all general ideas are in reality particular ones attached to a general term which recalls upon occasion other particular ones that resemble in certain circumstances the idea present to the mind. Thus when the term Horse is pronounced we immediately gure to ourselves the idea of a black or a white animal of a particular size or gure But as that term is also usually applied to animals of other colours gures and sizes these ideas though not actually present to the imagination are easily recalled and our reasoning and conclusion proceed in the same way as if they were actually present. If this be admitted as seems reasonable it follows that all the ideas of quantity upon which mathematicians reason are nothing but particular and such as are suggested by the senses and imagination and consequently cannot be innitely divisible. It is sucient to have dropped this hint at present without pros ecuting it any farther. It certainly concerns all lovers of science not to expose themselves to the ridicule and contempt of the ignorant by their conclusions and this seems the readiest solution of these diculties. Endnote to 12.29 p. T hat impious maxim of the ancient philosophy Ex nihilo nihil t by which the creation of matter was excluded ceases to be a maxim accord ing to this philosophy. Not only the will of the supreme Being may create matter but for aught we know priori the will of any other being might create it or any other cause that the most whimsical imagination can assign. Humes Endnotes 131 156 158 164 This page intentionally left blank APPENDIX I Abstract of a Treatise of Human Nature THIS abstract now generally agreed to have been composed by Hume himself was published anonymously in in an attempt to promote and explicate Books I and II of the Treatise of Human Nature which had been published in Januar. A valuable resource with elegant and concise presentations of some of Humes principal arguments it also indicates which of them he took to be most central and important to his philosophical project. It is striking and signicant that the structure focus and ordering of the Abstract though osten sibly describing the Treatise actually bears much closer resemblance to a quite dierent work the rst Enquiry which was still eight years away. For detailed discussion of this matter setting it in a wider context see my essay The Context Aims and Structure of Humes First Enquiry chapter 1 of Peter Millican ed. Reading Hume on Human Understanding OU. The text here is taken from the original edition with marginal numbers cor responding to the pages of the standard SelbyBigge and Nidditch edition of the Treatise and Abstract OUP 2nd edn. . AN ABSTRACT OF a BOOK lately Published entituled a TREATISE OF Human Nature c. Tis however certain that those who are not accustomed to abstract reasoning are apt to lose the thread of argument where it is drawn out to a great length and each part fortied with all the arguments guarded against all the objections and illus trated with all the views which occur to a writer in the diligent survey of his subject. Such Readers will more readily apprehend a chain of reasoning that is more single and concise where the chief propositions only are linkt on to each other illustrated by some simple examples and conrmed by a few of the more forcible arguments. The parts lying nearer together can better be compared and the connexion be more easily traced from the rst principles to the last conclusion. The work of which I here present the Reader with an abstract has been complained of as obscure and dicult to be comprehended and I am apt to 641 643 Appendix I 134 644 645 think that this proceeded as much from the length as from the abstractedness of the argument. If I have remedyd this inconvenience in any degree I have attaind my end. The book seemd to me to have such an air of singularity and novelty as claimd the attention of the public especially if it be found as the Author seems to insinuate that were his philosophy receivd we must alter from the foundation the greatest part of the sciences. Such bold attempts are always advantageous in the republic of letters because they shake othe yoke of authority accustom men to think for themselves give new hints which men of genius may carry farther and by the very opposition illustrate points wherein no one before suspected any diculty. The Author must be contented to wait with patience for some time before the learned world can agree in their sentiments of his performance. Tis his misfor tune that he cannot make an appeal to the people who in all matters of common reason and eloquence are found so infallible a tribunal. He must be judgd by the Few whose verdict is more apt to be corrupted by partiality and prejudice especially as no one is a proper judge in these subjects who has not often thought of them and such are apt to form to themselves systems of their own which they resolve not to relinquish. I hope the Author will excuse me for intermeddling in this aair since my aim is only to encrease his auditory by removing some diculties which have kept many from apprehending his meaning. I have chosen one simple argument which I have carefully traced from the beginning to the end. This is the only point I have taken care to nish. The rest is only hints of particular passages which seemd to me curious and remarkable. AN ABSTRACT OF a BOOK lately Published entituled a Treatise of Human Nature c. T his book seems to be wrote upon the same plan with several other works that have had a great vogue of late years in England. The philo sophical spirit which has been so much improved all over Europe within these last fourscore years has been carried to as great a length in this kingdom as in any other. Our writers seem even to have started a new kind of philosophy which promises more both to the entertainment and advantage of mankind than any other with which the world has been yet acquainted. Most of the philosophers of antiquity who treated of human nature have shewn more of a delicacy of sentiment a just sense of morals or a greatness of soul than a depth of reasoning and reection. They con tent themselves with representing the common sense of mankind in the strongest lights and with the best turn of thought and expression without following out steadily a chain of propositions or forming the several truths into a regular science. But tis at least worth while to try if the science of man will not admit of the same accuracy which several parts of natural phil osophy are found susceptible of. There seems to be all the reason in the world to imagine that it may be carried to the greatest degree of exactness. If in examining several phaenomena we nd that they resolve themselves into one common principle and can trace this principle into another we shall at last arrive at those few simple principles on which all the rest depend. And tho we can never arrive at the ultimate principles tis a sat isfaction to go as far as our faculties will allow us. This seems to have been the aim of our late philosophers and among the rest of this author. He proposes to anatomize human nature in a regular manner and promises to draw no conclusions but where he is author ized by experience. He talks with contempt of hypotheses and insinuates that such of our countrymen as have banished them from moral philosophy have done a more signal service to the world than my Lord Bacon whom he considers as the father of experimental physicks. He mentions on this occasion Mr. Locke my Lord Shaftesbury Dr. Mandeville Mr. Hutcheson Dr. Butler who tho they dier in many points among themselves seem all to agree in founding their accurate disquisitions of human nature entirely upon experience. Beside the satisfaction of being acquainted with what most nearly concerns us it may be safely armed that almost all the sciences are com prehended in the science of human nature and are dependent on it. The sole end of logic is to explain the principles and operations of our reasoning fac ulty and the nature of our ideas morals and criticism regard our tastes and sen timents and politics consider men as united in society and dependent on each other. This treatise therefore of human nature seems intended for a system of the sciences. The author has nished what regards logic and has laid the foundations of the other parts in his account of the passions. The celebrated Monsieur Leibnitz has observed it to be a defect in the common systems of logic that they are very copious when they explain the operations of the understanding in the forming of demonstrations but are too concise when they treat of probabilities and those other measures of evidence on which life and action entirely depend and which are our guides even in most of our philosophical speculations. In this censure he comprehends the Essay on human understanding le Recherche de la verit and LArt de penser. The author of the Treatise of human nature seems to have been sensible of this defect in these philosophers and has endeav oured as much as he can to supply it. As his book contains a great number of speculations very new and remarkable it will be impossible to give the reader a just notion of the whole. We shall therefore chiey conne our selves to his explication of our reasonings from cause and eect. If we can make this intelligible to the reader it may serve as a specimen of the whole. Abstract of a Treatise of Human Nature 135 646 647 Our author begins with some denitions. He calls a perception what ever can be present to the mind whether we employ our senses or are actuated with passion or exercise our thought and reection. He divides our perceptions into two kinds viz. When we feel a passion or emotion of any kind or have the images of external objects conveyed by our senses the perception of the mind is what he calls an impression which is a word that he employs in a new sense. When we reect on a passion or an object which is not present this perception is an idea. Impressions therefore are our lively and strong perceptions ideas are the fainter and weaker. This distinction is evident as evident as that betwixt feeling and thinking. The rst proposition he advances is that all our ideas or weak per ceptions are derived from our impressions or strong perceptions and that we can never think of any thing which we have not seen without us or felt in our own minds. This proposition seems to be equivalent to that which Mr. Locke has taken such pains to establish viz. Only it may be observed as an inaccuracy of that famous philosopher that he comprehends all our perceptions under the term of idea in which sense it is false that we have no innate ideas. For it is evident our stronger per ceptions or impressions are innate and that natural aection love of virtue resentment and all the other passions arise immediately from nature. I am perswaded whoever would take the question in this light would be easily able to reconcile all parties. Father Malebranche would nd himself at a loss to point out any thought of the mind which did not represent something antecedently felt by it either internally or by means of the external senses and must allow that however we may compound and mix and augment and diminish our ideas they are all derived from these sources. Locke on the other hand would readily acknowledge that all our passions are a kind of natural instincts derived from nothing but the original constitution of the human mind. Our author thinks that no discovery coud have been made more happily for deciding all controversies concerning ideas than this that impres sions always take the precedency of them and that every idea with which the imagination is furnishd rst makes its appearance in a correspondent impression. These latter perceptions are all so clear and evident that they admit of no controversy tho many of our ideas are so obscure that tis almost impossible even for the mind which forms them to tell exactly their nature and composition. Accordingly wherever any idea is ambigu ous he has always recourse to the impression which must render it clear and precise. And when he suspects that any philosophical term has no idea annexed to it as is too common he always asks from what impression that pre tended idea is derived And if no impression can be produced he concludes Appendix I 136 648 649 that the term is altogether insignicant. Tis after this manner he examines our idea of substance and essence and it were to be wished that this rigor ous method were more practised in all philosophical debates. Tis evident that all reasonings concerning matter of fact are founded on the relation of cause and eect and that we can never infer the exis tence of one object from another unless they be connected together either mediately or immediately. In order therefore to understand these reason ings we must be perfectly acquainted with the idea of a cause and in order to that must look about us to nd something that is the cause of another. Here is a billiardball lying on the table and another ball moving towards it with rapidity. They strike and the ball which was formerly at rest now acquires a motion. This is as perfect an instance of the relation of cause and eect as any which we know either by sensation or reection. Let us therefore examine it. Tis evident that the two balls touched one another before the motion was communicated and that there was no inter val betwixt the shock and the motion. Contiguity in time and place is there fore a requisite circumstance to the operation of all causes. Tis evident likewise that the motion which was the cause is prior to the motion which was the eect. Priority in time is therefore another requisite circum stance in every cause. But this is not all. Let us try any other balls of the same kind in a like situation and we shall always nd that the impulse of the one produces motion in the other. Here therefore is a third circumstance viz. Every object like the cause produces always some object like the eect. Beyond these three cir cumstances of contiguity priority and constant conjunction I can discover nothing in this cause. The rst ball is in motion touches the second imme diately the second is in motion and when I try the experiment with the same or like balls in the same or like circumstances I nd that upon the motion and touch of the one ball motion always follows in the other. In whatever shape I turn this matter and however I examine it I can nd nothing farther. This is the case when both the cause and eect are present to the senses. Let us now see upon what our inference is founded when we con clude from the one that the other has existed or will exist. Suppose I see a ball moving in a streight line towards another I immediately conclude that they will shock and that the second will be in motion. This is the inference from cause to eect and of this nature are all our reasonings in the conduct of life on this is founded all our belief in history and from hence is derived all philosophy excepting only geometry and arithmetic. If we can explain the inference from the shock of two balls we shall be able to account for this operation of the mind in all instances. Were a man such as Adam created in the full vigour of understand ing without experience he would never be able to infer motion in the second Abstract of a Treatise of Human Nature 137 650 ball from the motion and impulse of the rst. It is not any thing that reason sees in the cause which makes us infer the eect. Such an inference were it possible would amount to a demonstration as being founded merely on the comparison of ideas. But no inference from cause to eect amounts to a demonstration. Of which there is this evident proof. The mind can always conceive any eect to follow from any cause and indeed any event to follow upon another whatever we conceive is possible at least in a metaphysical sense but wherever a demonstration takes place the contrary is impossible and implies a contradiction. There is no demonstration therefore for any conjunction of cause and eect. And this is a principle which is generally allowed by philosophers. It would have been necessary therefore for Adam if he was not inspired to have had experience of the eect which followed upon the impulse of these two balls. He must have seen in several instances that when the one ball struck upon the other the second always acquired motion. If he had seen a sucient number of instances of this kind whenever he saw the one ball moving towards the other he would always conclude without hesitation that the second would acquire motion. His understanding would anticipate his sight and form a conclusion suitable to his past experience. It follows then that all reasonings concerning cause and eect are founded on experience and that all reasonings from experience are founded on the supposition that the course of nature will continue uniformly the same. We conclude that like causes in like circumstances will always pro duce like eects. It may now be worth while to consider what determines us to form a conclusion of such innite consequence. Tis evident that Adam with all his science would never have been able to demonstrate that the course of nature must continue uniformly the same and that the future must be conformable to the past. What is possible can never be demonstrated to be false and tis possible the course of nature may change since we can conceive such a change. Nay I will go farther and assert that he could not so much as prove by any probable arguments that the future must be conformable to the past. All probable arguments are built on the supposition that there is this conformity betwixt the future and the past and therefore can never prove it. This conformity is a matter of fact and if it must be proved will admit of no proof but from experience. But our experience in the past can be a proof of nothing for the future but upon a supposition that there is a resemblance betwixt them. This therefore is a point which can admit of no proof at all and which we take for granted without any proof. We are determined by custom alone to suppose the future conform able to the past. When I see a billiardball moving towards another my mind is immediately carryd by habit to the usual eect and anticipates my sight Appendix I 138 651 652 by conceiving the second ball in motion. There is nothing in these objects abstractly considered and independent of experience which leads me to form any such conclusion and even after I have had experience of many repeated eects of this kind there is no argument which determines me to suppose that the eect will be conformable to past experience. The powers by which bodies operate are entirely unknown. We perceive only their sensible qualities and what reason have we to think that the same powers will always be conjoined with the same sensible qualities Tis not therefore reason which is the guide of life but custom. That alone determines the mind in all instances to suppose the future conforma ble to the past. However easy this step may seem reason would never to all eternity be able to make it. This is a very curious discovery but leads us to others that are still more curious. When I see a billiardball moving towards another my mind is immediately carryd by habit to the usual eect and anticipates my sight by con ceiving the second ball in motion. But is this all Do I nothing but conceive the motion of the second ball No surely. I also believe that it will move. What then is this belief And how does it dier from the simple conception of any thing Here is a new question unthought of by philosophers. When a demonstration convinces me of any proposition it not only makes me conceive the proposition but also makes me sensible that tis impossible to conceive any thing contrary. What is demonstratively false implies a contradiction and what implies a contradiction cannot be con ceived. But with regard to any matter of fact however strong the proof may be from experience I can always conceive the contrary tho I cannot always believe it. The belief therefore makes some dierence betwixt the concep tion to which we assent and that to which we do not assent. To account for this there are only two hypotheses. It may be said that belief joins some new idea to those which we may conceive without assenting to them. But this hypothesis is false. For rst no such idea can be produced. When we simply conceive an object we conceive it in all its parts. We conceive it as it might exist tho we do not believe it to exist. Our belief of it would discover no new qualities. We may paint out the entire object in imagination without believing it. We may set it in a manner before our eyes with every circumstance of time and place. Tis the very object conceived as it might exist and when we believe it we can do no more. Secondly The mind has a faculty of joining all ideas together which involve not a contradiction and therefore if belief consisted in some idea which we add to the simple conception it would be in a mans power by adding this idea to it to believe any thing which he can conceive. Since therefore belief implies a conception and yet is something more and since it adds no new idea to the conception it follows that it is Abstract of a Treatise of Human Nature 139 653 a dierent manner of conceiving an object something that is distinguish able to the feeling and depends not upon our will as all our ideas do. My mind runs by habit from the visible object of one ball moving towards another to the usual eect of motion in the second ball. It not only con ceives that motion but feels something dierent in the conception of it from a mere reverie of the imagination. The presence of this visible object and the constant conjunction of that particular eect render the idea dierent to the feeling from those loose ideas which come into the mind without any introduction. This conclusion seems a little surprizing but we are led into it by a chain of propositions which admit of no doubt. To ease the readers memory I shall briey resume them. No matter of fact can be proved but from its cause or its eect. Nothing can be known to be the cause of another but by experience. We can give no reason for extending to the future our experience in the past but are entirely determined by custom when we con ceive an eect to follow from its usual cause. But we also believe an eect to follow as well as conceive it. This belief joins no new idea to the conception. It only varies the manner of conceiving and makes a dierence to the feeling or sentiment. Belief therefore in all matters of fact arises only from custom and is an idea conceived in a peculiar manner. Our author proceeds to explain the manner or feeling which renders belief dierent from a loose conception. He seems sensible that tis impos sible by words to describe this feeling which every one must be conscious of in his own breast. He calls it sometimes a stronger conception sometimes a more lively a more vivid a rmer or a more intense conception. And indeed whatever name we may give to this feeling which constitutes belief our author thinks it evident that it has a more forcible eect on the mind than ction and mere conception. This he proves by its inuence on the passions and on the imagination which are only moved by truth or what is taken for such. Poetry with all its art can never cause a passion like one in real life. It fails in the original conception of its objects which never feel in the same manner as those which command our belief and opinion. Our author presuming that he had suciently proved that the ideas we assent to are dierent to the feeling from the other ideas and that this feeling is more rm and lively than our common conception endeavours in the next place to explain the cause of this lively feeling by an analogy with other acts of the mind. His reasoning seems to be curious but could scarce be rendered intelligible or at least probable to the reader without a long detail which would exceed the compass I have prescribed to myself. I have likewise omitted many arguments which he adduces to prove that belief consists merely in a peculiar feeling or sentiment. I shall only mention one. Our past experience is not always uniform. Sometimes one eect follows from a cause sometimes another In which case we always Appendix I 140 654 655 believe that that will exist which is most common. I see a billiardball moving towards another. I cannot distinguish whether it moves upon its axis or was struck so as to skim along the table. In the rst case I know it will not stop after the shock. In the second it may stop. The rst is most common and therefore I lay my account with that eect. But I also conceive the other eect and conceive it as possible and as connected with the cause. Were not the one conception dierent in the feeling or sentiment from the other there would be no dierence betwixt them. We have connd ourselves in this whole reasoning to the relation of cause and eect as discovered in the motions and operations of matter. But the same reasoning extends to the operations of the mind. Whether we consider the inuence of the will in moving our body or in governing our thought it may safely be armed that we could never foretel the eect merely from the consideration of the cause without experience. And even after we have experience of these eects tis custom alone not reason which determines us to make it the standard of our future judgments. When the cause is presented the mind from habit immediately passes to the concep tion and belief of the usual eect. This belief is something dierent from the conception. It does not however join any new idea to it. It only makes it be felt dierently and renders it stronger and more lively. Having dispatcht this material point concerning the nature of the inference from cause and eect our author returns upon his footsteps and examines anew the idea of that relation. In the considering of motion com municated from one ball to another we could nd nothing but contiguity priority in the cause and constant conjunction. But beside these circum stances tis commonly supposd that there is a necessary connexion betwixt the cause and eect and that the cause possesses something which we call a power or force or energy. The question is what idea is annexd to these terms If all our ideas or thoughts be derived from our impressions this power must either discover itself to our senses or to our internal feeling. But so little does any power discover itself to the senses in the operations of matter that the Cartesians have made no scruple to assert that matter is utterly deprived of energy and that all its operations are performd merely by the energy of the supreme Being. But the question still recurs What idea have we of energy or power even in the supreme Being All our idea of a Deity according to those who deny innate ideas is nothing but a composition of those ideas which we acquire from reecting on the operations of our own minds. Now our own minds aord us no more notion of energy than matter does. When we consider our will or volition a priori abstracting from ex perience we are never able to infer any eect from it. And when we take the assistance of experience it only shows us objects contiguous successive and constantly conjoined. Upon the whole then either we have no idea at Abstract of a Treatise of Human Nature 141 656 657 all of force and energy and these words are altogether insignicant or they can mean nothing but that determination of the thought acquird by habit to pass from the cause to its usual eect. But whoever would thoroughly understand this must consult the author himself. Tis sucient if I can make the learned world apprehend that there is some diculty in the case and that whoever solves the diculty must say some thing very new and extraordinary as new as the diculty itself. By all that has been said the reader will easily perceive that the phi losophy containd in this book is very sceptical and tends to give us a notion of the imperfections and narrow limits of human understanding. Almost all reasoning is there reduced to experience and the belief which attends experience is explained to be nothing but a peculiar sentiment or lively conception produced by habit. Nor is this all. When we believe any thing of external existence or suppose an object to exist a moment after it is no longer perceived this belief is nothing but a sentiment of the same kind. Our author insists upon several other sceptical topics and upon the whole concludes that we assent to our faculties and employ our reason only because we cannot help it. Philosophy woud render us entirely Pyrrhonian were not nature too strong for it. I shall conclude the logics of this author with an account of two opin ions which seem to be peculiar to himself as indeed are most of his opinions. He asserts that the soul as far as we can conceive it is nothing but a system or train of dierent perceptions those of heat and cold love and anger thoughts and sensations all united together but without any perfect simplic ity or identity. Des Cartes maintained that thought was the essence of the mind not this thought or that thought but thought in general. This seems to be absolutely unintelligible since every thing that exists is particular And therefore it must be our several particular perceptions that compose the mind. I say compose the mind not belong to it. The mind is not a sub stance in which the perceptions inhere. That notion is as unintelligible as the Cartesian that thought or perception in general is the essence of the mind. We have no idea of substance of any kind since we have no idea but what is derived from some impression and we have no impression of any substance either material or spiritual. We know nothing but particular qualities and perceptions. As our idea of any body a peach for instance is only that of a particular taste colour gure size consistence c. So our idea of any mind is only that of particular perceptions without the notion of any thing we call substance either simple or compound. The second principle which I proposed to take notice of is with regard to Geometry. Having denied the innite divisibility of extension our author nds himself obliged to refute those mathematical arguments which have been adduced for it and these indeed are the only ones of any weight. Appendix I 142 658 This he does by denying Geometry to be a science exact enough to admit of conclusions so subtile as those which regard innite divisibility. His arguments may be thus explained. All Geometry is founded on the notions of equality and inequality and therefore according as we have or have not an exact standard of those relations the science itself will or will not admit of great exactness. Now there is an exact standard of equality if we sup pose that quantity is composed of indivisible points. Two lines are equal when the numbers of the points that compose them are equal and when there is a point in one corresponding to a point in the other. But tho this standard be exact tis useless since we can never compute the number of points in any line. It is besides founded on the supposition of nite divis ibility and therefore can never aord any conclusion against it. If we reject this standard of equality we have none that has any pretensions to exact ness. I nd two that are commonly made use of. Two lines above a yard for instance are said to be equal when they contain any inferior quantity as an inch an equal number of times. But this runs in a circle. For the quan tity we call an inch in the one is supposed to be equal to what we call an inch in the other And the question still is by what standard we proceed when we judge them to be equal or in other words what we mean when we say they are equal. If we take still inferior quantities we go on in innitum. This therefore is no standard of equality. The greatest part of philosophers when askd what they mean by equality say that the word admits of no denition and that it is sucient to place before us two equal bodies such as two diameters of a circle to make us understand that term. Now this is taking the general appearance of the objects for the standard of that propor tion and renders our imagination and senses the ultimate judges of it. But such a standard admits of no exactness and can never aord any conclu sion contrary to the imagination and senses. Whether this reasoning be just or not must be left to the learned world to judge. Twere certainly to be wishd that some expedient were fallen upon to reconcile philosophy and common sense which with regard to the question of innite divisibility have wagd most cruel wars with each other. We must now proceed to give some account of the second volume of this work which treats of the Passions. Tis of more easy comprehension than the rst but contains opinions that are altogether as new and extraor dinary. The author begins with pride and humility. He observes that the objects which excite these passions are very numerous and seemingly very dierent from each other. Pride or selfesteem may arise from the qualities of the mind wit goodsense learning courage integrity from those of the body beauty strength agility good mein address in dancing riding fencing from external advantages country family children relations riches houses gardens horses dogs cloaths. He afterwards proceeds to Abstract of a Treatise of Human Nature 143 659 660 nd out that common circumstance in which all these objects agree and which causes them to operate on the passions. His theory likewise extends to love and hatred and other aections. As these questions tho curious could not be rendered intelligible without a long discourse we shall here omit them. It may perhaps be more acceptable to the reader to be informed of what our author says concerning freewill. He has laid the foundation of his doctrine in what he said concerning cause and eect as above explained. Tis universally acknowledgd that the operations of external bodies are necessary and that in the communication of their motion in their attrac tion and mutual cohesion there are not the least traces of indierence or lib erty. Whatever therefore is in this respect on the same footing with matter must be acknowledgd to be necessary. That we may know whether this be the case with the actions of the mind we may examine matter and consider on what the idea of a necessity in its operations is founded and why we conclude one body or action to be the infallible cause of another. It has been observd already that in no single instance the ultimate connexion of any objects is discoverable either by our senses or reason and that we can never penetrate so far into the essence and construction of bodies as to perceive the principle on which their mutual inuence is founded. Tis their constant union alone with which we are acquainted and tis from the constant union the necessity arises when the mind is determined to pass from one object to its usual attendant and infer the existence of one from that of the other. Here then are two particulars which we are to regard as essen tial to necessity viz. Now nothing is more evident than the constant union of particular actions with particular motives. If all actions be not constantly united with their proper motives this uncertainty is no more than what may be observed every day in the actions of matter where by reason of the mixture and uncertainty of causes the eect is often variable and uncertain. Thirty grains of opium will kill any man that is not accustomed to it tho thirty grains of rhubarb will not always purge him. In like manner the fear of death will always make a man go twenty paces out of his road tho it will not always make him do a bad action. And as there is often a constant conjunction of the actions of the will with their motives so the inference from the one to the other is often as certain as any reasoning concerning bodies and there is always an infer ence proportioned to the constancy of the conjunction. On this is founded our belief in witnesses our credit in history and indeed all kinds of moral evidence and almost the whole conduct of life. Our author pretends that this reasoning puts the whole controversy in a new light by giving a new denition of necessity. And indeed the most Appendix I 144 661 zealous advocates for freewill must allow this union and inference with regard to human actions. They will only deny that this makes the whole of necessity. But then they must shew that we have an idea of something else in the actions of matter which according to the foregoing reasoning is impossible. Thro this whole book there are great pretensions to new discover ies in philosophy but if any thing can intitle the author to so glorious a name as that of an Inventor tis the use he makes of the principle of the association of ideas which enters into most of his philosophy. Our imagi nation has a great authority over our ideas and there are no ideas that are dierent from each other which it cannot separate and join and compose into all the varieties of ction. But notwithstanding the empire of the imagination there is a secret tie or union among particular ideas which causes the mind to conjoin them more frequently together and makes the one upon its appearance introduce the other. Hence arises what we call the apropos of discourse hence the connection of writing and hence that thread or chain of thought which a man naturally supports even in the loosest reverie. These principles of association are reduced to three viz. Resemblance a picture naturally makes us think of the man it was drawn for. Contiguity when St. Dennis is mentioned the idea of Paris naturally occurs. Causation when we think of the son we are apt to carry our atten tion to the father. Twill be easy to conceive of what vast consequence these principles must be in the science of human nature if we consider that so far as regards the mind these are the only links that bind the parts of the universe together or connect us with any person or object exterior to ourselves. For as it is by means of thought only that any thing operates upon our passions and as these are the only ties of our thoughts they are really to us the cement of the universe and all the operations of the mind must in a great measure depend on them. FINIS Abstract of a Treatise of Human Nature 145 662 APPENDIX II Of the Immortality of the Soul THIS essay was originally planned for Publication in a projected collection called Five Dissertations but Hume decided to withdraw it together with another religiously dangerous piece on suicide prior to Publication. The two essays were replaced with Of the Standard of Taste and the collection appeared in under the name Four Dissertations. The suppressed essays were eventu ally published posthumously and anonymously in but this textlike the standard edition of Miller follows instead the version of which a proofcopy exists in the National Library of Scotland with twenty corrections in Humes handwriting. The marginal page numbers refer to Millers edition to facilitate crossreference. Had the topic of immortality not been so dangerous it is likely that the Enquiry would have included more explicit discussion of it especially given Section XIs overt concern with a future state. But quite apart from this the philosophical style of the essay is exactly in the spirit of the Enquiry and provides an excellent illus tration of Humes approach. Its rst and last paragraphs also illustrate the sort of theological lying so common at the time through which atheistic writers preserved the formal decencies by giving an appearance of orthodoxy. The Enquiry itself contains other examples at the end of Sections VIII and X at the beginning of Section XI and also at 12.32. Of the Immortality of the Soul By the mere light of reason it seems dicult to prove the Immortality of the Soul. The arguments for it are commonly derived either from metaphysical topics or moral or physical. But in reality it is the gospel and the gospel alone that has brought life and immortality to light. Metaphysical topics are founded on the supposition that the soul is immaterial and that it is impossible for thought to belong to a material substance. But just metaphysics teach us that the notion of substance is wholly confused and imperfect and that we have no other idea of any substance than as an aggregate of particular qualities inhering in an unknown some thing. Matter therefore and spirit are at bottom equally unknown and we cannot determine what qualities may inhere in the one or in the other. They likewise teach us that nothing can be decided a priori concerning any cause or eect and that experience being the only source of our judg ments of this nature we cannot know from any other principle whether 590 591 matter by its structure or arrangement may not be the cause of thought. Abstract reasonings cannot decide any question of fact or existence. But admitting a spiritual substance to be dispersed throughout the universe like the etherial re of the Stoics and to be the only inherent subject of thought we have reason to conclude from analogy that nature uses it after the same manner she does the other substance matter. She employs it as a kind of paste or clay modies it into a variety of forms and existences dissolves after a time each modication and from its substance erects a new form. As the same material substance may successively com pose the body of all animals the same spiritual substance may compose their minds Their consciousness or that system of thought which they formed during life may be continually dissolved by death and nothing interest them in the new modication. The most positive asserters of the mortality of the soul never denied the immortality of its substance. And that an immaterial substance as well as a material may lose its memory or consciousness appears in part from experience if the soul be immaterial. Reasoning from the common course of nature and without supposing any new interposition of the supreme cause which ought always to be excluded from philosophy what is incorruptible must also be ingenerable. The soul therefore if immortal existed before our birth And if the former state of existence no wise concerned us neither will the latter. Animals undoubtedly feel think love hate will and even reason tho in a more imperfect manner than man. Are their souls also immaterial and immortal II. Let us now consider the moral arguments chiey those arguments derived from the justice of God which is supposed to be farther interested in the farther punishment of the vicious and reward of the virtuous. But these arguments are grounded on the supposition that God has attributes beyond what he has exerted in this universe with which alone we are acquainted. Whence do we infer the existence of these attributes It is very safe for us to arm that whatever we know the deity to have actually done is best but it is very dangerous to arm that he must always do what to us seems best. In how many instances would this rea soning fail us with regard to the present world But if any purpose of nature be clear we may arm that the whole scope and intention of mans creation so far as we can judge by natural reason is limited to the present life. With how weak a concern from the original inher ent structure of the mind and passions does he ever look farther What comparison either for steddiness or ecacy between so oating an idea and the most doubtful persuasion of any matter of fact that occurs in common life. There arise indeed in some minds some unaccountable terrors with regard to futurity But these would quickly vanish were they not articially Of the Immortality of the Soul 147 592 593 fostered by precept and education. And those who foster them what is their motive Only to gain a livelihood and to acquire power and riches in this world. Their very zeal and industry therefore are an argument against them. What cruelty what iniquity what injustice in nature to conne thus all our concern as well as all our knowledge to the present life if there be another scene still awaiting us of innitely greater consequence Ought this barbarous deceit to be ascribed to a benecent and wise being Observe with what exact proportion the task to be performed and the performing powers are adjusted throughout all nature. If the reason of man gives him a great superiority above other animals his necessities are proportionably multiplied upon him. His whole time his whole capacity activity courage passion nd sucient employment in fencing against the miseries of his present condition. And frequently nay almost always are too slender for the business assigned them. A pair of shoes perhaps was never yet wrought to the highest degree of perfection which that commodity is capable of attaining. Yet is it necessary at least very useful that there should be some politicians and moralists even some geometers historians poets and philosophers among mankind. The powers of men are no more superior to their wants considered merely in this life than those of foxes and hares are compared to their wants and to their period of existence. The inference from parity of reason is therefore obvious. On the theory of the souls mortality the inferiority of womens capac ity is easily accounted for Their domestic life requires no higher faculties either of mind or body. This circumstance vanishes and becomes absolutely insignicant on the religious theory The one sex has an equal task to per form with the other Their powers of reason and resolution ought also to have been equal and both of them innitely greater than at present. As every eect implies a cause and that another till we reach the rst cause of all which is the Deity every thing that happens is ordained by him and nothing can be the object of his punishment or vengeance. By what rule are punishments and rewards distributed What is the divine standard of merit and demerit Shall we suppose that human sentiments have place in the deity However bold that hypothesis we have no conception of any other sentiments. According to human sentiments sense courage good manners industry prudence genius c. Shall we therefore erect an elysium for poets and heroes like that of the antient mythology Why conne all rewards to one species of virtue Punishment without any proper end or purpose is inconsistent with our ideas of goodness and justice and no end can be served by it after the whole scene is closed. Appendix II 148 594 Punishment according to our conceptions should bear some propor tion to the oence. Why then eternal punishment for the temporary oences of so frail a creature as man Can any one approve of Alexanders rage who intended to exterminate a whole nation because they had seized his favourite horse Bucephalus1 Heaven and hell suppose two distinct species of men the good and the bad. But the greatest part of mankind oat between vice and virtue. Were one to go round the world with an intention of giving a good supper to the righteous and a sound drubbing to the wicked he would fre quently be embarrassed in his choice and would nd that the merits and the demerits of most men and women scarcely amount to the value of either. To suppose measures of approbation and blame dierent from the human confounds every thing. Whence do we learn that there is such a thing as moral distinctions but from our own sentiments What man who has not met with personal provocation or what good naturd man who has could inict on crimes from the sense of blame alone even the common legal frivolous punishments And does any thing steel the breast of judges and juries against the sentiments of humanity but reections on necessity and public interest By the Roman law those who had been guilty of parricide and confessed their crime were put into a sack along with an ape a dog and a serpent and thrown into the river Death alone was the punishment of those who denied their guilt however fully proved. A criminal was tryed before Augustus and condemned after full conviction But the humane emperor when he put the last interrogatory gave it such a turn as to lead the wretch into a denial of his guilt. You surely said the prince did not kill your father 2. This lenity suits our natural ideas of RIGHT even towards the greatest of all criminals and even tho it prevents so inconsiderable a suerance. Nay even the most bigotted priest would naturally without reection approve of it provided the crime was not heresy or indelity. For as these crimes hurt himself in his temporal interests and advantages perhaps he may not be altogether so indulgent to them. The chief source of moral ideas is the reection on the interest of human society. Ought these interests so short so frivolous to be guarded by punish ments eternal and innite The damnation of one man is an innitely greater evil in the universe than the subversion of a thousand millions of kingdoms. Nature has rendered human infancy peculiarly frail and mortal as it were on purpose to refute the notion of a probationary state. The half of mankind dye before they are rational creatures. Of the Immortality of the Soul 149 595 596 1 Quint. Curtius lib. The physical arguments from the analogy of nature are strong for the mortality of the soul and these are really the only philosophical argu ments which ought to be admitted with regard to this question or indeed any question of fact. Where any two objects are so closely connected that all alterations which we have ever seen in the one are attended with proportionable alterations in the other we ought to conclude by all rules of analogy that when there are still greater alterations produced in the former and it is totally dissolved there follows a total dissolution of the latter. Sleep a very small eect on the body is attended with a temporary extinction at least a great confusion in the soul. The weakness of the body and that of the mind in infancy are exactly proportioned their vigor in manhood their sympathetic disorder in sick ness their common gradual decay in old age. The step further seems unavoidable their common dissolution in death. The last symptoms which the mind discovers are disorder weakness insensibility stupidity the forerunners of its annihilation. The farther progress of the same causes encreasing the same eects totally extinguish it. Judging by the usual analogy of nature no form can continue when transferred to a condition of life very dierent from the original one in which it was placed. Trees perish in the water shes in the air animals in the earth. Even so small a dierence as that of climate is often fatal. What reason then to imagine that an immense alteration such as is made on the soul by the dissolution of its body and all its organs of thought and sensation can be eected without the dissolution of the whole Every thing is in common between soul and body. The organs of the one are all of them the organs of the other. The existence therefore of the one must be dependent on that of the other. The souls of animals are allowed to be mortal and these bear so near a resemblance to the souls of men that the analogy from one to the other forms a very strong argument. Their bodies are not more resembling yet no one rejects the arguments drawn from comparative anatomy. The Metempsychosis is therefore the only system of this kind that philosophy can so much as hearken to. Nothing in this world is perpetual. Every being however seemingly rm is in continual ux and change The world itself gives symptoms of frailty and dissolution How contrary to analogy therefore to imagine that one single form seemingly the frailest of any and from the slightest causes subject to the greatest disorders is immortal and indissoluble What a daring theory is that How lightly not to say how rashly entertained How to dispose of the innite number of posthumous existences ought also to embarrass the religious theory. Every planet in every solar system Appendix II 150 597 we are at liberty to imagine peopled with intelligent mortal beings At least we can x on no other supposition. For these then a new universe must every generation be created beyond the bounds of the present universe or one must have been created at rst so prodigiously wide as to admit of this continual inux of beings. Ought such bold suppositions to be received by any philosophy and that merely on the pretence of a bare possibility When it is asked whether Agamemnon Thersites Hannibal Nero and every stupid clown that ever existed in Italy Scythia Bactria or Guinea are now alive can any man think that a scrutiny of nature will furnish arguments strong enough to answer so strange a question in the armative The want of arguments without revelation suciently establishes the negative. Quanto facilius says Pliny 3 certiusque sibi quemque credere ac specimen securitatis antigenitali sumere experimento. Our insensibility before the composition of the body seems to natural reason a proof of a like state after its dissolution. Were our horror of annihilation an original passion not the eect of our general love of happiness it would rather prove the mortality of the soul. For as nature does nothing in vain she would never give us a horror against an impossible event. She may give us a horror against an unavoidable event provided our endeavours as in the present case may often remove it to some distance. Death is in the end unavoidable yet the human species could not be preserved had not nature inspired us with an aversion towards it. All doctrines are to be suspected which are favoured by our passions. And the hopes and fears which gave rise to this doctrine are very obvious. It is an innite advantage in every controversy to defend the negative. If the question be out of the common experienced course of nature this cir cumstance is almost if not altogether decisive. By what arguments or analogies can we prove any state of existence which no one ever saw and which no wise resembles any that ever was seen Who will repose such trust in any pretended philosophy as to admit upon its testimony the reality of so marvellous a scene Some new species of logic is requisite for that purpose and some new facul ties of the mind which may enable us to comprehend that logic. Nothing could set in a fuller light the innite obligations which mankind have to divine revelation since we nd that no other medium could ascertain this great and important truth. Of the Immortality of the Soul 151 598 3 Lib. APPENDIX III Excerpts from Parts I and II of the Dialogues concerning Natural Religion HUMES Dialogues were published posthumously in having been revised shortly before his death in though most of the contentespecially of the early sectionswas probably completed by only four years after the Publication of the rst Enquiry. Parts I and II of the Dialogues contain a good deal of general material on the understanding of scepticism with Philo the character described by Hume as a careless sceptic presenting a point of view strikingly similar to that expressed in Enquiry Section XII. In Part I Philo provides important explanation of the motivation for this scepticism which in some respects goes beyond anything in the Enquiry. Then Cleanthes the experimental theist and proponent of the Design Argument for Gods exis tence makes interesting criticisms some of which are not clearly answered by Philo nor indeed by Hume in other works. This raises the interesting possibility that Hume himself might have been grappling with potentially strong objections to aspects of his scepticism notably concerning the basis of his recommendation expressed at E 12.25 to restrict our enquiries to common life. In Part II Cleanthes presents his Design Argument the logic of which Philo elucidates for the benet of Demea an orthodox believer before delivering criticisms closely related to those in Enquiry Section XI. The text that follows is taken from the rst edition of with marginal page numbers to facilitate reference to the standard edition by Norman Kemp Smith Macmilla. PART . . . . . The vulgar who are unacquainted with science and profound enquiry observing the endless disputes of the learned have commonly a thorough contempt for Philosophy and rivet themselves the faster by that means in the great points of Theology which have been taught them. Those who enter a little into study and enquiry nding many appearances of evidence in doctrines the newest and most extraor dinary think nothing too dicult for human reason and presumptuously breaking through all fences profane the inmost sanctuaries of the temple. When these topics are displayed in their full light as they are by some philosophers and almost all divines who can retain such condence in this frail faculty of reason as to pay any regard to its determi nations in points so sublime so abstruse so remote from common life and experience When the coherence of the parts of a stone or even that com position of parts which renders it extended when these familiar objects I say are so inexplicable and contain circumstances so repugnant and con tradictory with what assurance can we decide concerning the origin of worlds or trace their history from eternity to eternit . . You propose then Philo said Cleanthes to erect religious faith on philosophical scepticism and you think that if certainty or evidence be expelled from every other subject of enquiry it will all retire to these theo logical doctrines and there acquire a superior force and authority. Whether your scepticism be as absolute and sincere as you pretend we shall learn by and by when the company breaks up We shall then see whether you go out at the door or the window and whether you really doubt if your body has gravity or can be injured by its fall according to popular opinion derived from our fallacious senses and more fallacious experience. . . . In reality Philo continued he it seems certain that though a man in a ush of humour after intense reection on the many contradictions and imperfections of human reason may entirely renounce all belief and opinion it is impossible for him to persevere in this total scepticism or make it appear in his conduct for a few hours. External objects press in upon him Passions solicit him His philosophical melancholy dissipates and even the utmost violence upon his own temper will not be able during any time to preserve the poor appearance of scepticism. And for what reason impose on himself such a violence This is a point in which it will be impossible for him ever to satisfy himself consistently with his sceptical principles So that upon the whole nothing could be more ridiculous than the principles of the ancient Pyrrhonians if in reality they endeavoured as is pretended to extend throughout the same scepticism which they had learned from the declamations of their schools and which they ought to have conned to them. In this view there appears a great resemblance between the sects of the Stoics and Pyrrhonians though perpetual antagonists and both of Dialogues concerning Natural Religion 153 132 133 them seem founded on this erroneous maxim That what a man can perform sometimes and in some dispositions he can perform always and in every disposition. When the mind by Stoical reections is elevated into a sublime enthusiasm of virtue and strongly smit with any Species of honour or public good the utmost bodily pain and suerance will not prevail over such a high sense of duty and tis possible perhaps by its means even to smile and exult in the midst of tortures. If this sometimes may be the case in fact and reality much more may a philosopher in his school or even in his closet work himself up to such an enthusiasm and support in imagination the acutest pain or most calamitous event which he can possibly conceive. But how shall he support this enthusiasm itself The bent of his mind relaxes and cannot be recalled at pleasure Avocations lead him astray Misfortunes attack him unawares And the philosopher sinks by degrees into the plebian. I allow of your comparison between the Stoics and Sceptics replied Philo. But you may observe at the same time that though the mind cannot in Stoicism support the highest ights of philosophy yet even when it sinks lower it still retains somewhat of its former disposition and the eects of the Stoics reasoning will appear in his conduct in common life and through the whole tenor of his actions. The ancient schools particularly that of Zeno produced examples of virtue and constancy which seem astonishing to pres ent time . . . In like manner if a man has accustomed himself to sceptical considerations on the uncertainty and narrow limits of reason he will not entirely forget them when he turns his reection on other subjects but in all his philosophical principles and reasoning I dare not say in his common conduct he will be found dierent from those who either never formed any opinions in the case or have entertained sentiments more favourable to human reason. To whatever length any one may push his speculative principles of scep ticism he must act I own and live and converse like other men and for this conduct he is not obliged to give any other reason than the absolute neces sity he lies under of so doing. If he ever carries his speculations farther than this necessity constrains him and philosophises either on natural or moral subjects he is allured by a certain pleasure and satisfaction which he nds in employing himself after that manner. He considers besides that every one even in common life is constrained to have more or less of this philos ophy that from our earliest infancy we make continual advances in forming more general principles of conduct and reasoning that the larger experience we acquire and the stronger reason we are endued with we always render our principles the more general and comprehensive and that what we call philosophy is nothing but a more regular and methodical operation of the same kind. To philosophise on such subjects is nothing essentially dierent from reasoning on common life and we may only expect greater stability Appendix III 154 134 if not greater truth from our philosophy on account of its exacter and more scrupulous method of proceeding. But when we look beyond human aairs and the properties of the sur rounding bodies When we carry our speculations into the two eternities before and after the present state of things into the creation and formation of the universe the existence and properties of spirits the powers and oper ations of one universal spirit existing without beginning and without end omnipotent omniscient immutable innite and incomprehensible We must be far removed from the smallest tendency to scepticism not to be apprehensive that we have here got quite beyond the reach of our faculties. So long as we conne our speculations to trade or morals or politics or crit icism we make appeals every moment to common sense and experience which strengthen our philosophical conclusions and remove at least in part the suspicion which we so justly entertain with regard to every reason ing that is very subtile and rened. But in theological reasonings we have not this advantage while at the same time we are employed upon objects which we must be sensible are too large for our grasp and of all others require most to be familiarised to our apprehension. We are like foreigners in a strange country to whom every thing must seem suspicious and who are in danger every moment of transgressing against the laws and customs of the people with whom they live and converse. We know not how far we ought to trust our vulgar methods of reasoning in such a subject since even in common life and in that province which is peculiarly appropriated to them we cannot account for them and are entirely guided by a kind of instinct or necessity in employing them. All sceptics pretend that if reason be considered in an abstract view it furnishes invincible arguments against itself and that we could never retain any conviction or assurance on any subject were not the sceptical reason ings so rened and subtile that they are not able to counterpoise the more solid and more natural arguments derived from the senses and experience. But it is evident whenever our arguments lose this advantage and run wide of common life that the most rened scepticism comes to be upon a footing with them and is able to oppose and counterbalance them. The one has no more weight than the other. The mind must remain in suspense between them and it is that very suspense or balance which is the triumph of scepticism. But I observe says Cleanthes with regard to you Philo and all speculative sceptics that your doctrine and practice are as much at variance in the most abstruse points of theory as in the conduct of common life. Whereever evidence discovers itself you adhere to it notwithstanding your pretended scepticism and I can observe too some of your sect to be as decisive as those who make greater professions of certainty and assurance. Dialogues concerning Natural Religion 155 135 136 In reality would not a man be ridiculous who pretended to reject Newtons explication of the wonderful phenomenon of the rainbow because that explication gives a minute anatomy of the rays of light a subject forsooth too rened for human comprehension And what would you say to one who having nothing particular to object to the arguments of Copernicus and Galilaeo for the motion of the earth should withhold his assent on that general principle That these subjects were too magnicent and remote to be explained by the narrow and fallacious reason of mankind There is indeed a kind of brutish and ignorant scepticism as you well observed which gives the vulgar a general prejudice against what they do not easily understand and makes them reject every principle which requires elaborate reasoning to prove and establish it. This species of scepticism is fatal to knowledge not to religion since we nd that those who make greatest profession of it give often their assent not only to the great truths of Theism and natural theology but even to the most absurd tenets which a traditional superstition has recommended to them. They rmly believe in witches though they will not believe nor attend to the most simple proposition of Euclid. But the rened and philosophical sceptics fall into an inconsistence of an opposite nature. They push their researches into the most abstruse corners of science and their assent attends them in every step proportioned to the evidence which they meet with. They are even obliged to acknowledge that the most abstruse and remote objects are those which are best explained by philosophy. Light is in reality anatomized The true system of the heavenly bodies is discovered and ascertained. But the nourishment of bodies by food is still an inexplicable mystery The cohesion of the parts of matter is still incomprehensible. These sceptics therefore are obliged in every question to consider each particular evidence apart and proportion their assent to the precise degree of evidence which occurs. This is their practice in all natural mathematical moral and political science. And why not the same I ask in the theological and religious Why must conclu sions of this nature be alone rejected on the general presumption of the insuciency of human reason without any particular discussion of the evi dence Is not such an unequal conduct a plain proof of prejudice and passio . . In vain would the sceptic make a distinction between science and common life or between one science and another. The arguments employed in all if just are of a similar nature and contain the same force and evidence. Or if there be any dierence among them the advantage lies entirely on the side of theology and natural religion. Many principles of mechanics are founded on very abstruse reasoning yet no man who has any pretensions to science even no speculative sceptic pretends to entertain the least doubt with regard to them. The Copernican system contains the most Appendix III 156 137 138 surprising paradox and the most contrary to our natural conceptions to appearances and to our very senses yet even monks and inquisitors are now constrained to withdraw their opposition to it. And shall Philo a man of so liberal a genius and extensive knowledge entertain any general undis tinguished scruples with regard to the religious hypothesis which is founded on the simplest and most obvious arguments and unless it meets with articial obstacles has such easy access and admission into the mind of ma . . PART I . . Not to lose any time in circumlocutions said Cleanthes addressing himself to Deme . . I shall briey explain how I conceive this matter. Look round the world contemplate the whole and every part of it You will nd it to be nothing but one great machine subdivided into an innite number of lesser machines which again admit of subdivisions to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and explain. All these various machines and even their most minute parts are adjusted to each other with an accuracy which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends through out all nature resembles exactly though it much exceeds the productions of human contrivance of human design thought wisdom and intelligence. Since therefore the eects resemble each other we are led to infer by all the rules of analogy that the causes also resemble and that the Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man though possessed of much larger faculties proportioned to the grandeur of the work which he has executed. By this argument a posteriori and by this argument alone do we prove at once the existence of a Deity and his similarity to human mind and intelligence. I shall be so free Cleanthes said Demea as to tell you that from the beginning I could not approve of your conclusion concerning the similarity of the Deity to men still less can I approve of the mediums by which you endeavour to establish it. What No demonstration of the Being of a God No abstract arguments No proofs a prior . . Can we reach no farther in this subject than experience and probabilit . . . . . . . . Now however much I may dissent in other respects from the dangerous principles of Cleanthes I must allow that he has fairly represented that argument and I shall endeavour so to state the matter to you that you will entertain no farther scruples with regard to it. Dialogues concerning Natural Religion 157 143 145 Were a man to abstract from every thing which he knows or has seen he would be altogether incapable merely from his own ideas to determine what kind of scene the universe must be or to give the preference to one state or situation of things above another. For as nothing which he clearly conceives could be esteemed impossible or implying a contradiction every chimera of his fancy would be upon an equal footing nor could he assign any just reason why he adheres to one idea or system and rejects the others which are equally possible. Again after he opens his eyes and contemplates the world as it really is it would be impossible for him at rst to assign the cause of any one event much less of the whole of things or of the universe. He might set his Fancy a rambling and she might bring him in an innite variety of reports and representations. These would all be possible but being all equally possible he would never of himself give a satisfactory account for his preferring one of them to the rest. Experience alone can point out to him the true cause of any phenomenon. Now according to this method of reasoning Demea it follows and is indeed tacitly allowed by Cleanthes himself that order arrangement or the adjustment of nal causes is not of itself any proof of design but only so far as it has been experienced to proceed from that principle. For aught we can know a priori matter may contain the source or spring of order originally within itself as well as mind does and there is no more diculty in conceiving that the several elements from an internal unknown cause may fall into the most exquisite arrangement than to conceive that their ideas in the great universal mind from a like internal unknown cause fall into that arrangement. The equal possibility of both these suppositions is allowed. But by experience we nd according to Cleanthes that there is a dierence between them. Throw several pieces of steel together without shape or form they will never arrange themselves so as to compose a watch Stone and mortar and wood without an architect never erect a house. But the ideas in a human mind we see by an unknown inexplicable oeconomy arrange themselves so as to form the plan of a watch or house. Experience therefore proves that there is an original principle of order in mind not in matter. From similar eects we infer similar causes. The adjustment of means to ends is alike in the universe as in a machine of human contrivance. The causes therefore must be resembling. . . . But can you think Cleanthes that your usual phlegm and philosophy have been preserved in so wide a step as you have taken when you compared to the universe houses ships furniture machines and from their similarity in some circumstances inferred a similarity in their causes Thought design intelligence such as we discover in men and other animals is no more than Appendix III 158 146 147 one of the springs and principles of the universe as well as heat or cold attraction or repulsion and a hundred others which fall under daily observation. It is an active cause by which some particular parts of nature we nd produce alterations on other parts. But can a conclusion with any propriety be transferred from parts to the whole Does not the great disproportion bar all comparison and inference From observing the growth of a hair can we learn any thing concerning the generation of a man Would the manner of a leafs blowing even though perfectly known aord us any instruction concerning the vegetation of a tre . . Admirable conclusion Stone wood brick iron brass have not at this time in this minute globe of earth an order or arrangement without human art and contrivance therefore the universe could not originally attain its order and arrangement without something similar to human art. But is a part of nature a rule for another part very wide of the former Is it a rule for the whole Is a very small part a rule for the universe Is nature in one situation a certain rule for nature in another situation vastly dierent from the forme . . When two species of objects have always been observed to be con joined together I can infer by custom the existence of one whereever I see the existence of the other and this I call an argument from experience. But how this argument can have place where the objects as in the present case are single individual without parallel or specic resemblance may be dicult to explain. And will any man tell me with a serious countenance that an orderly universe must arise from some thought and art like the human because we have experience of it To ascertain this reasoning it were requisite that we had experience of the origin of worlds and it is not sucient surely that we have seen ships and cities arise from human art and contrivance. . . . What I had to suggest said Cleanthes is only that you would not abuse terms or make use of popular expressions to subvert philosophical rea sonings. You know that the vulgar often distinguish reason from experience even where the question relates only to matter of fact and existence though it is found where that reason is properly analysed that it is nothing but a species of experience. To prove by experience the origin of the universe from mind is not more contrary to common speech than to prove the motion of the earth from the same principle. And a caviller might raise all the same objections to the COPERNICAN system which you have urged against my reasonings. Have you other earths might he say which you have seen to move Have. . . . . . . . . . . . Yes cried Philo interrupting him we have other earths. Is not the moon another earth which we see to turn round its centre Is not Venus Dialogues concerning Natural Religion 159 149 150 another earth where we observe the same phenomenon Are not the rev olutions of the sun also a conrmation from analogy of the same theory All the planets are they not earths which revolve about the sun Are not the satellites moons which move round Jupiter and Saturn and along with these primary planets round the sun These analogies and resem blances with others which I have not mentioned are the sole proofs of the COPERNICAN system and to you it belongs to consider whether you have any analogies of the same kind to support your theory. In reality Cleanthes continued he the modern system of astronomy is now so much received by all enquirers and has become so essential a part even of our earliest education that we are not commonly very scrupulous in examining the reasons upon which it is founded. . . . But if we peruse Galilaeos famous Dialogues concerning the system of the world we shall nd that that great genius one of the sublimest that ever existed rst bent all his endeavours to prove that there was no foundation for the distinction commonly made between elementary and celestial substances. The schools proceeding from the illusions of sense had carried this distinc tion very far and had established the latter substances to be ingenerable incorruptible unalterable impassable and had assigned all the opposite qualities to the former. But Galilaeo beginning with the moon proved its similarity in every particular to the earth its convex gure its natural darkness when not illuminated its density its distinction into solid and liquid the variations of its phases the mutual illuminations of the earth and moon their mutual eclipses the inequalities of the lunar surface c. After many instances of this kind with regard to all the planets men plainly saw that these bodies became proper objects of experience and that the similar ity of their nature enabled us to extend the same arguments and phenomena from one to the other. In this cautious proceeding of the astronomers you may read your own condemnation Cleanthes or rather may see that the subject in which you are engaged exceeds all human reason and enquiry. Can you pretend to show any such similarity between the fabric of a house and the generation of a universe Have you ever seen Nature in any such situation as resembles the rst arrangement of the elements Have worlds ever been formed under your eye and have you had leisure to observe the whole progress of the phenomenon from the rst appearance of order to its nal consummation If you have then cite your experience and deliver your theory. Appendix III 160 151 APPENDIX IV Excerpts from Humes Letters THE excerpts reprinted here shed light on dierent aspects of the Enquiry and its background. Several concern the Treatise of Human Nature Humes rst book which he published in Books I and II and Book III and his increasing dissatisfaction with that juvenile work. As reported in My Own Life see Appendix V this dissatisfaction led to his recasting of the material to create the two Enquiries and the Dissertation on the Passions with the rst Enquiry inheriting what remained from Book I and the Book II sections on Liberty and Necessity. Other excerpts concern the religious content of the Enquiry especially the controversial Section X on miracles. Hume was of course fully aware that such sceptical arguments would provoke opposition and it is interesting to see his changing attitude to this as reected in these letters. To Henry Home from London 2 December Hume writes this letter to his kinsman Henry Home generally known by his later Title of Lord Kames about some deletions that he is making from his Treatise of Human Nature prior to Publication. Hume says that he is removing parts evidently dealing with religionthat might be oensive to Dr Joseph Butler an Anglican bishop whose major philosophical work The Analogy of Religion had been published the previous year. Hume plans to give Butler a copy of the Treatise in the hope of a good opinion. The letter indicates that the eventual Treatise is in a sense incomplete and that Humes interest in his phi losophys religious implications was there from the start. The letter also demon strates in particular that Hume had written some material on miracles over a year before the Publication of the Treatise which also tends to undermine the old view expressed by SelbyBigge in the introduction to his Enquiry edition that the religious material was articially and rather frivolously added to the Enquiry to spice it up as a means of provoking public interest rather than from any serious philosophical concern. Having a frankt Letter I was resolvd to make Use of it accordingly enclose some Reasonings concerning Miracles which I once thought of publishing with the rest but which I am afraid will give too much Oence even as the World is disposd at present. There is Something in the turn of Thought a good deal in the Turn of Expression which will not perhaps appear so proper for want of knowing the Context But the Force of the Argument youll be judge of as it stands. Tell me your Thoughts of it. Is not the Style too diuse Appendix IV Tho as that was a popular Argument I have spread it out much more than the other Parts of the Work. I beg of you to show it to no Bod . . Your Thoughts mine agree with Respect to Dr Butler I woud be glad to be introducd to him. I am at present castrating my Work that is cutting oits noble Parts that is endeavouring it shall give as little Oence as possible before which I coud not pretend to put it into the Drs hands. This is a Piece of Cowardice for which I blame myself tho I believe none of my Friends will blame me. But I was resolvd not to be an Enthusiast in Philosophy while I was blaming other Enthusiasms. If ever I indulge any twill be when I tell that I am Dear Sir Yours. NHL 2 To Henry Home from Ninewells 1 June Barely four months after the Publication of Books I and II of the Treatise and with disappointing news of sales Hume is already expressing doubts about the wisdom of Publication. I am now out of Humour with myself but doubt not in a little time to be only out of Humour with the World like other unsuccessful Authors. After all I am sensible of my Folly in entertaining any Discontent much more Despair upon this Account since I coud not expect any better from such abstract Reasoning nor indeed did I promise myself much better. My Fondness for what I imagind new Discoveries made me overlook all common Rules of Prudence having enjoyd the usual Satisfaction of Projectors tis but just I shoud meet with their Dissappointments. NHL 5 To Francis Hutcheson from Ninewells 16 March The following year Humes dissatisfaction with the Treatise is clear as he longs for the opportunity to make corrections in a second edition which in fact never occurred. I wait with some Impatience for a second Edition principally on Account of Alterations I intend to make in my Performance. This is an Advantage that we Authors possess since the Invention of Printing renders the Nonum prematur in annum not so necessary to us as to the Antients. Without it I shoud have been guilty of a very great Temerity to publish at my Years so many Noveltys in so delicate a Part of Philosophy And at any Rate I am afraid that I must plead as my Excuse that very Circumstance of Youth which may be urgd against me. I assure you that without running any of the heights of Scepticism I am apt in a cool hour to suspect in general that most of my Reasonings will be more useful by furnishing Hints exciting Peoples Curiosity than as containing any Principles that will 162 Excerpts from Humes Letters 163 augment the Stock of Knowledge that must pass to future Ages. HL i. 89 To James Oswald of Dunnikier from Ninewells 2 October Eight years after the Publication of the Treatise Hume is now relatively unconcerned about the implications of publishing an indel book though he reveals that Harry i.e. Henry Home has seen the manuscript of the Philosophical Essays i.e. The letter to Henry Home himself makes similar points. . . . I have some thoughts o . . Our friend Harry is against this as indiscreet. But in the rst place I think I am too deep engaged to think of a retreat. In the second place I see not what bad consequences follow in the present age from the character of an indel especially if a mans conduct be in other respects irreproachable. What is your opinion HL i. 06 To Henry Home from London 9 February I leave here two works going on a new edition of my Essay . . The other work is the Philosophical Essays which you dissuaded me from printing. I wont justify the prudence of this step any other way than by expressing my indierence about all the consequences that may follow. . . . HL i. 11 To Gilbert Elliot of Minto March or April Having published the Philosophical Essays i.e. I believe the philosophical Essays contain every thing of Consequence relating to the Understanding which you woud meet with in the Treatise I give you my Advice against reading the latter. By shortening simpli fying the Questions I really render them much more complete. Addo dum minuo. The philosophical Principles are the same in both But I was carryd away by the Heat of Youth Invention to publish too precipitately. So vast an Undertaking pland before I was one and twenty composd before twenty ve must necessarily be very defective. I have repented my Haste a hundred a hundred times. HL i. 58 To John Stewart February Stewart had taken Hume to be denying the Causal Maxim in Treatise 1.3.3 and after correcting him on this point Hume continues with some comments indicating that he no longer has any interest in a second edition of the Treatise. Appendix IV 164 Where a man of Sense mistakes my Meaning I own I am angry But it is only at myself For having exprest my Meaning so ill as to have given Occasion to the Mistake. That you may see I woud no way scruple of owning my Mistakes in Argument I shall acknowledge what is innitely more material a very great Mistake in Conduct viz my publishing at all the Treatise of human Nature a Book which pretended to innovate in all the sublimest Parts of Philosophy which I composd before I was ve twenty. Above all the positive Air which prevails in that Book which may be imputed to the Ardor of Youth so much displeases me that I have not Patience to review it. But what Success the same Doctrines better illustrated exprest may meet with Ad huc sub judice lis est. HL i. 87 To the Abb le Blanc from Edinburgh 12 September le Blanc had translated Humes Political Discourses and Hume writes to advise about the best editions of his other works should le Blanc also be interested in translating those. The second sentence conrms Humes awareness that the rst Enquiry is both bold i.e. The Booksellers are reprinting in London the philosophical Essays but the second Edition diers very little from this new one. I doubt these Essays are both too bold too metaphysical for your Climate tho we have lately in some French Writers been entertaind with Liberties that are not much inferior. HL i. 92 To the Reverend Hugh Blair probably in the autumn of Blair had been instrumental in sending Hume a manuscript of George Campbells Dissertation on Miracles which would be published i. This letter gives Humes comments in reply which throw interesting light on the material of Enquiry Section X. I would desire the author to consider whether the medium by which we reason concerning human testimony be dierent from that which leads us to draw any inferences concerning other human actions that is our knowledge of human nature from experience Or why is it dierent I suppose we conclude an honest man will not lie to us in the same manner as we conclude that he will not cheat us. As to the youthful propensity to believe which is corrected by experience it seems obvious that children adopt blindfold all the opinions principles sentiments and passions of their elders as well as credit their testimony nor is this more strange than that a hammer should make an impression on clay. Excerpts from Humes Letters 165 Sect. No man can have any other experience but his own. The ex perience of others becomes his only by the credit which he gives to their testimony which proceeds from his own experience of human nature. There is no contradiction in saying that all the testimony which ever was really given for any miracle or ever will be given is a sub ject of derision and yet forming a ction or supposition of a testimony for a particular miracle which might not only merit attention but amount to a full proof of it. For instance the absence of the sun during 48 hours but reasonable men would only conclude from this fact that the machine of the globe was disordered during the time. I nd no diculty to explain my meaning and yet shall not probably do it in any future edition. The proof against a miracle as it is founded on invariable experience is of that species or kind of proof which is full and certain when taken alone because it implies no doubt as is the case with all probabilities but there are degrees of this species and when a weaker proof is opposed to a stronger it is overcome. There is very little more delicacy in telling a man he speaks nonsense by implication than in saying so directly. Does a man of sense run after every silly tale of witches or hobgoblins or fairies and canvass particularly the evidence I never knew any one that examined and deliberated about nonsense who did not believe it before the end of his inquiries. I wonder the author does not perceive the reason why Mr John Knox and Mr Alexander Henderson did not work as many miracles as their brethren in other churches. Miracleworking was a Popish trick and discarded with the other parts of that religion. Men must have new and opposite ways of establishing new and opposite follies. The same reason extends to Mahomet. The Greek priests who were in the neighbourhood of Arabia and many of them in it were as great miracleworkers as the Romish and Mahomet would have been laughed at for so stale and simple a device. To cast out devils and cure the blind where every one almost can do as much is not the way to get any extraordinary ascendant over men. I never read of a miracle in my life that was not meant to establish some new point of religion. There are no miracles wrought in Spain to prove the Gospel but St Francis Xavier wrought a thousand well attested ones for that purpose in the Indies. The miracles in Spain which are also fully and completely attested are wrought to prove the ecacy of a particular crucix or relict which is always a new point or at least not universally received. If a miracle proves a doctrine to be revealed from God and consequently true a miracle can never be wrought for a contrary doctrine. The facts are therefore as incompatible as the doctrines. Appendix IV 166 I could wish your friend had not denominated me an indel writer on account of ten or twelve pages which seem to him to have that tendency while I have wrote so many volumes on history literature politics trade morals which in that particular at least are entirely inoensive. Is a man to be called a drunkard because he has been seen fuddled once in his lifetime Having said so much to your friend who is certainly a very ingenious man tho a little too zealous for a philosopher permit me also the freedom of saying a word to yourself. Whenever I have had the pleasure to be in your company if the discourse turned upon any common subject of liter ature or reasoning I always parted from you both entertained and instructed. But when the conversation was diverted by you from this channel towards the subject of your profession tho I doubt not but your intentions were very friendly towards me I own I never received the same satisfaction I was apt to be tired and you to be angry. I would therefore wish for the future wherever my good fortune throws me in your way that these topics should be forborne between us. I have long since done with all inquiries on such subjects and am become incapable of instruc tion tho I own no one is more capable of conveying it than yourself. After having given you the liberty of communicating to your friend what part of this letter you think proper I remain Sir Your most obedient humble servant david hume. HL i. 4951 To the Reverend George Campbell 7 June Evidently Humes comments on Campbells manuscript had some eect par ticularly on the style of the published Dissertation. In this letter directly to the author Hume expresses his appreciation but also his general reluctance to enter into controversies with philosophical opponents which regrettably for his com mentators he retained throughout his life. He also makes interesting comments about the genesis of his famous argument against miracles. Dear Sir It has so seldom happened that controversies in philosophy much more in theology have been carried on without producing a personal quarrel between the parties that I must regard my present situation as somewhat extraordinary who have reason to give you thanks for the civil and oblig ing manner in which you have conducted the dispute against me on so interesting a subject as that of miracles. Any little symptoms of vehemence of which I formerly used the freedom to complain when you favoured me with a sight of the manuscript are either removed or explained away or Excerpts from Humes Letters 167 atoned for by civilities which are far beyond what I have any Title to pretend to. It will be natural for you to imagine that I will fall upon some shift to evade the force of your arguments and to retain my former opinion in the point controverted between us but it is impossible for me not to see the ingenuity of your performance and the great learning which you have dis played against me. I consider myself as very much honoured in being thought worthy of an answer by a person of so much merit and as I nd that the public does you justice with regard to the ingenuity and good composition of your piece I hope you will have no reason to repent engaging with an antagonist whom perhaps in strictness you might have ventured to neglect. I own to you that I never felt so violent an inclination to defend myself as at present when I am thus fairly challenged by you and I think I could nd something specious at least to urge in my defence but as I had xed a resolution in the beginning of my life always to leave the public to judge between my adver saries and me without making any reply. I must adhere inviolably to this resolution otherways my silence on any future occasion would be construed an inability to answer and would be matter of triumph against me. It may perhaps amuse you to learn the rst hint which suggested to me that argument which you have so strenuously attacked. I was walking in the cloisters of the Jesuits College of La Flche a town in which I passed two years of my youth and engaged in a conversation with a Jesuit of some parts and learning who was relating to me and urging some nonsensical miracle performed in their convent when I was tempted to dispute against him and as my head was full of the topics of my Treatise of Human Nature which I was at that time composing this argument immediately occurred to me and I thought it very much gravelled my companion but at last he observed to me that it was impossible for that argument to have any solidity because it operated equally against the Gospel as the Catholic miracleswhich observation I thought proper to admit as a sucient answer. I believe you will allow that the freedom at least of this reasoning makes it somewhat extraordinary to have been the produce of a convent of Jesuits tho perhaps you may think the sophistry of it savours plainly of the place of its birth. HL i. 601 To William Strahan from Edinburgh 26 October Here Hume asks his printer to prex his famous Advertisement publicly renouncing the Treatise to future editions of the volume containing the Enquiry. He also makes clear that he is still at work on corrections to what would become the edition. See the Note on the Text pp. Appendix IV 168 But we must not part without my also saying something as an Author. I have not yet thrown up so much all Memory of that Character. There is a short Advertisement which I wish I had prexd to the second Volume of the Essays and Treatises in the last Edition. I send you a Copy of it. Please to enquire at the Warehouse if any considerable Number of that Edition remain on hands and if there do I beg the favour of you that you woud throw oan equal Number of this Advertisement and give out no more Copies without prexing it to the second volume. It is a compleat Answer to Dr Reid and to that bigotted silly Fellow Beattie. I believe that I have formerly mentiond to you that no new Editions shoud be made of any of my Writings without mentioning it to me I shall still have some Corrections to make. . . . HL ii. APPENDIX V My Own Life WRITTEN in the year of his death when Hume was aware of the seriousness of his terminal illness this was sent to his printer William Strahan for inclusion in the forthcoming nal edition of Humes works but in the event was published sep arately i. This text is taken from that original Publication with a few small corrections made by comparison against Humes handwritten manuscript in the National Library of Scotland. HUME a few months before his death wrote the following short account of his own Life and in a codicil to his will desired that it might be prexed to the next edition of his Works. That edition cannot be pub lished for a considerable time. The Editor in the mean while in order to serve the purchasers of the former editions and at the same time to gratify the impatience of the public curiosity has thought proper to publish it sepa rately without altering even the Title or superscription which was written in Mr. Humes own hand on the cover of the manuscript. MY OWN LIFE It is dicult for a man to speak long of himself without vanity therefore I shall be short. It may be thought an instance of vanity that I pretend at all to write my life but this Narrative shall contain little more than the History of my Writings as indeed almost all my life has been spent in literary pursuits and occupations. The rst success of most of my writings was not such as to be an object of vanity. I was born the 26th of April old style at Edinburgh. I was of a good family both by father and mother my fathers family is a branch of the Earl of Homes or Humes and my ancestors had been proprietors of the estate which my brother possesses for several generations. My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer President of the College of Justice the Title of Lord Halkerton came by succession to her brother. My family however was not rich and being myself a younger brother my patrimony according to the mode of my country was of course very slender. My father who passed for a man of parts died when I was an infant leaving me with an elder brother and a sister under the care of our mother a woman of singular merit who though young and handsome devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of her children. I passed through the ordinary course of education with success and was seized very early with a passion for literature which has been the ruling passion of my life and the great source of my enjoyments. My studious disposition my sobriety and my industry gave my family a notion that the law was a proper profession for me but I found an unsurmountable aversion to every thing but the pursuits of philosophy and general learning and while they fancied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was secretly devouring. My very slender fortune however being unsuitable to this plan of life and my health being a little broken by my ardent Application I was tempted or rather forced to make a very feeble trial for entering into a more active scene of life. In I went to Bristol with some recommendations to eminent merchants but in a few months found that scene totally unsuitable to me. I went over to France with a view of prosecuting my studies in a country retreat and I there laid that plan of life which I have steadily and successfully pursued. I resolved to make a very rigid frugality supply my deciency of fortune to maintain unimpaired my independency and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvement of my talents in literature. During my retreat in France rst at Reims but chiey at La Fleche in Anjou I composed my Treatise of Human Nature. After passing three years very agreeably in that country I came over to London i. In the end of I published my Treatise and immediately went down to my mother and my brother who lived at his countryhouse and was employ ing himself very judiciously and successfully in the improvement of his fortune. Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatise of Human Nature. It fell deadborn from the press without reaching such dis tinction as even to excite a murmur among the zealots. But being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper I very soon recovered the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country. In I printed at Edinburgh the rst part of my Essays the work was favourably received and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment. I continued with my mother and brother in the country and in that time recovered the knowledge of the Greek language which I had too much neglected in my early youth. In I received a letter from the Marquis of Annandale inviting me to come and live with him in England I found also that the friends and family of that young nobleman were desirous of putting him under my care and direction for the state of his mind and health required it. I lived with him a twelvemonth. My appointments during that time made a considerable Appendix V 170 My Own Life 171 accession to my small fortune. I then received an invitation from General St. Clair to attend him as a secretary to his expedition which was at rst meant against Canada but ended in an incursion on the coast of France. Next year to wit I received an invitation from the General to attend him in the same station in his military embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin. I there wore the uniform of an ocer and was introduced at these courts as aiddecamp to the general along with Sir Harry Erskine and Captain Grant now General Grant. These two years were almost the only interruptions which my studies have received during the course of my life I passed them agreeably and in good company and my appointments with my frugality had made me reach a fortune which I called independ ent though most of my friends were inclined to smile when I said so in short I was now master of near a thousand pounds. I had always entertained a notion that my want of success in publish ing the Treatise of Human Nature had proceeded more from the manner than the matter and that I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion in going to the press too early. I therefore cast the rst part of that work anew in the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding which was published while I was at Turin. But this piece was at rst but little more successful than the Treatise of Human Nature. On my return from Italy I had the mortication to nd all England in a ferment on account of Dr. Middletons Free Enquiry while my performance was entirely overlooked and neglected. A new edition which had been published at London of my Essays moral and political met not with a much better reception. Such is the force of natural temper that these disappointments made little or no impression on me. I went down in and lived two years with my brother at his countryhouse for my mother was now dead. I there com posed the second part of my Essays which I called Political Discourses and also my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals which is another part of my Treatise that I cast anew. Meanwhile my bookseller A. Millar informed me that my former publications all but the unfortunate Treatise were beginning to be the subject of conversation that the sale of them was gradually increasing and that new editions were demanded. Answers by Reverends and Right Reverends came out two or three in a year and I found by Dr. Warburtons railing that the books were beginning to be esteemed in good company. However I had xed a resolution which I inexibly maintained never to reply to any body and not being very irascible in my temper I have easily kept myself clear of all literary squabbles. These symp toms of a rising reputation gave me encouragement as I was ever more disposed to see the favourable than unfavourable side of things a turn of mind which it is more happy to possess than to be born to an estate of ten thousand a year. In I removed from the country to the town the true scene for a man of letters. In were published at Edinburgh where I then lived my Political Discourses the only work of mine that was successful on the rst Publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the same year was published at London my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals which in my own opinion who ought not to judge on that subject is of all my writings historical philosophical or literary incomparably the best. It came unnoticed and unobserved into the world. In the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian an oce from which I received little or no emolument but which gave me the command of a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the History of England but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narrative through a period of years I commenced with the accession of the House of Stuart an epoch when I thought the misrepresentations of faction began chiey to take place. I was I own sanguine in my expectations of the success of this work. I thought that I was the only historian that had at once neglected present power interest and authority and the cry of popular prejudices and as the subject was suited to every capacity I expected proportional applause. But miserable was my disappointment I was assailed by one cry of reproach disapprobation and even detestation English Scotch and Irish Whig and Tory churchman and sectary freethinker and religionist patriot and courtier united in this rage against the man who had presumed to shed a generous tear for the fate of Charles I. Millar told me that in a twelve month he sold only fortyve copies of it. I scarcely indeed heard of one man in the three kingdoms considerable for rank or letters that could endure the book. I must only except the primate of England Dr. Herring and the primate of Ireland Dr. Stone which seem two odd exceptions. These dignied prelates separately sent me messages not to be discouraged. I was however I confess discouraged and had not the war been at that time breaking out between France and England I had certainly retired to some provincial town of the former kingdom have changed my name and never more have returned to my native country. But as this scheme was not now practicable and the subsequent volume was consid erably advanced I resolved to pick up courage and to persevere. In this interval I published at London my Natural History of Religion along with some other small pieces its public entry was rather obscure except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet against it with all the illiberal petulance arrogance and scurrility which distinguish the Warburtonian school. This pamphlet gave me some consolation for the otherwise indierent reception of my performance. Appendix V 172 In two years after the fall of the rst volume was published the second volume of my History containing the period from the death of Charles I. This performance happened to give less displeasure to the Whigs and was better received. It not only rose itself but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother. But though I had been taught by experience that the Whig party were in possession of bestowing all places both in the state and in literature I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamour that in above a hun dred alterations which farther study reading or reection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two rst Stuarts I have made all of them invariably to the Tory side. It is ridiculous to consider the English constitution before that period as a regular plan of liberty. In I published my History of the House of Tudor. The clam our against this performance was almost equal to that against the History of the two rst Stuarts. The reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious. But I was now callous against the impressions of public folly and con tinued very peaceably and contentedly in my retreat at Edinburgh to nish in two volumes the more early part of the English History which I gave to the public in with tolerable and but tolerable success. But notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons to which my writings had been exposed they had still been making such advances that the copymoney given me by the booksellers much exceeded any thing formerly known in England I was become not only independent but opu lent. I retired to my native country of Scotland determined never more to set my foot out of it and retaining the satisfaction of never having preferred a request to one great man or even making advances of friendship to any of them. As I was now turned of fty I thought of passing all the rest of my life in this philosophical manner when I received in an invitation from the Earl of Hertford with whom I was not in the least acquainted to attend him on his embassy to Paris with a near prospect of being appointed secretary to the embassy and in the meanwhile of performing the functions of that oce. This oer however inviting I at rst declined both because I was reluctant to begin connexions with the great and because I was afraid that the civilities and gay company of Paris would prove disagreeable to a person of my age and humour but on his lordships repeating the invitation I accepted of it. I have every reason both of pleasure and interest to think myself happy in my connexions with that nobleman as well as afterwards with his brother General Conway. Those who have not seen the strange eects of modes will never imagine the reception I met with at Paris from men and women of all ranks and stations. The more I recoiled from their excessive civilities the more I was loaded with them. There is however a real satisfaction in living at Paris My Own Life 173 from the great number of sensible knowing and polite company with which that city abounds above all places in the universe. I thought once of settling there for life. I was appointed secretary to the embassy and in summer Lord Hertford left me being appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. I was charg daaires till the arrival of the Duke of Richmond towards the end of the year. In the beginning of I left Paris and next summer went to Edinburgh with the same view as formerly of burying myself in a philo sophical retreat. I returned to that place not richer but with much more money and a much larger income by means of Lord Hertfords friendship than I left it and I was desirous of trying what superuity could produce as I had formerly made an experiment of a competency. But in I received from Mr. Conway an invitation to be Undersecretary and this invitation both the character of the person and my connexions with Lord Hertford prevented me from declining. I returned to Edinburgh in very opulent for I possessed a revenue of pounds a year healthy and though some what stricken in years with the prospect of enjoying long my ease and of seeing the increase of my reputation. In spring I was struck with a disorder in my bowels which at rst gave me no alarm but has since as I apprehend it become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have suered very little pain from my disorder and what is more strange have notwithstanding the great decline of my person never suered a moments abatement of my spirits insomuch that were I to name the period of my life which I should most choose to pass over again I might be tempted to point to this later period. I possess the same ardour as ever in study and the same gaiety in company. I consider besides that a man of sixtyve by dying cuts oonly a few years of inrmities and though I see many symptoms of my literary reputations breaking out at last with additional lustre I knew that I could have but few years to enjoy it. It is dicult to be more detached from life than I am at present. To conclude historically with my own character. I am or rather was for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments I was I say a man of mild dispositions of command of temper of an open social and cheerful humour capable of attachment but little susceptible of enmity and of great moderation in all my passions. Even my love of literary fame my ruling passion never soured my humour notwithstanding my frequent disappointments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless as well as to the studious and lit erary and as I took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women I had no reason to be displeased with the reception I met with from them. In a word though most men any wise eminent have found reason to complain Appendix V 174 of calumny I never was touched or even attacked by her baleful tooth and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct not but that the zealots we may well suppose would have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my disadvantage but they could never nd any which they thought would wear the face of prob ability. I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself but I hope it is not a misplaced one and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained. My Own Life 175 This page intentionally left blank TEXTUAL VARIANTS SECTION I Section I paragraph 14 originally ended with this note which appeared only in the and editions. Humes footnotes are indicated with numbers rather than the original symbols. That Faculty by which we discern Truth and Falshood and that by which we perceive Vice and Virtue had long been confounded with each other and all Morality was supposd to be built on eternal and immutable Relations which to every intelligent Mind were equally invariable as any Proposition concerning Quantity or Number. But late Philosopher has taught us by the most convincing Arguments that Morality is nothing in the abstract Nature of Things but is entirely relative to the Sentiment or mental Taste of each particular Being in the same Manner as the Distinctions of sweet and bitter hot and cold arise from the particular Feeling of each Sense or Organ. Moral Perceptions therefore ought not to be clasd with the Operations of the Understanding but with the Tastes or Sentiments. It had been usual with Philosophers to divide all the Passions of the Mind into two Classes the selsh and benevolent which were supposd to stand in constant Opposition and Contrariety nor was it thought that the latter could ever attain their proper Object but at the Expense of the former. Among the selsh Passions were rankd Avarice Ambition Revenge Among the benevolent natural Aection Friendship Public spirit. Philosophers may perceive the Impropriety of this Division. It has been provd beyond all Controversy that even the Passions commonly esteemd selsh carry the Mind beyond Self directly to the Object that tho the Satisfaction of these Passions gives us Enjoyment yet the Prospect of this Enjoyment is not the Cause of the Passion but on the contrary the Passion is antecedent to the Enjoyment and without the former the latter could never possibly exist that the Case is precisely the same with the Passions denominated benevolent and consequently that a Man is no more inter ested when he seeks his own Glory than when the Happiness of his Friend is the Object of his Wishes nor is he any more disinterested when he sacrices his Ease and Quiet to public Good than when he labours for the Gratication of Avarice and Ambition. Here therefore is a considerable 1 Mr. See Butlers Sermons. Adjustment in the Boundaries of the Passions which had been con founded by the Negligence or Inaccuracy of former Philosophers. These two Instances may suce to show us the Nature and Importance of this Species of Philosophy. SECTION III Section III originally continued signicantly beyond its current ending starting with an added nal sentence in paragraph 3. The additional material varied between the editions from to but was deleted in the nal edition. The text below is taken from the edition except that Humes footnote refer ring to Aristotle is here given in translation only and with a modern reference. Instead of entering into a detail of this kind which would lead into many useless subtilties we shall consider some of the eects of this connexion upon the passions and imagination where we may open a eld of speculation more entertaining and perhaps more instructive than the other. As a man is a reasonable being and is continually in pursuit of hap piness which he hopes to attain by the gratication of some passion or aection he seldom acts or speaks or thinks without a purpose and intention. He has still some object in view and however improper the means may sometimes be which he chuses for the attainment of his end he never loses view of an end nor will he so much as throw away his thoughts or reections where he hopes not to reap some satisfaction from them. In all compositions of genius therefore it is requisite that the writer have some plan or object and though he may be hurried from this plan by the vehemence of thought as in an ode or drop it carelessly as in an epistle or essay there must appear some aim or intention in his rst setting out if not in the composition of the whole work. A production without a design would resemble more the ravings of a madman than the sober eorts of genius and learning. As this rule admits of no exception it follows that in narrative compositions the events or actions which the writer relates must be connected together by some bond or tye They must be related to each other in the imagination and form a kind of Unity which may bring them under one plan or view and which may be the object or end of the writer in his rst undertaking. This connecting principle among the several events which form the subject of a poem or history may be very dierent according to the dierent designs of the poet or historian. Ovid has formed his plan upon the connecting principle of resemblance. Every fabulous transformation Textual Variants 178 produced by the miraculous power of the gods falls within the compass of his work. There needs but this one circumstance in any event to bring it under his original plan or intention. An annalist or historian who should undertake to write the history of Europe during any century would be inuenced by the connexion of contiguity in time and place. All events which happen in that portion of space and period of time are comprehended in his design though in other respects dierent and unconnected. They have still a species of unity amidst all their diversity. But the most usual species of connexion among the dierent events which enter into any narrative composition is that of cause and eect while the historian traces the series of actions according to their natural order remounts to their secret springs and principles and delineates their most remote consequences. He chuses for his subject a certain portion of that great chain of events which compose the history of mankind Each link in this chain he endeavours to touch in his narration Sometimes unavoidable ignorance renders all his attempts fruitless Sometimes he supplies by conjecture what is wanting in knowledge And always he is sensible that the more unbroken the chain is which he presents to his reader the more perfect is his production. He sees that the knowledge of causes is not only the most satisfactory this relation or connexion being the strongest of all others but also the most instructive since it is by this knowledge alone we are enabled to controul events and govern futurity. Here therefore we may attain some notion of that Unity of Action about which all critics after Aristotle have talked so much Perhaps to little purpose while they directed not their taste or sentiment by the accuracy of philosophy. It appears that in all productions as well as in the epic and tragic there is a certain unity required and that on no occasion can our thoughts be allowed to run at adventures if we would produce a work which will give any lasting entertainment to mankind. It appears also that even a biographer who should write the life of Achilles would connect the events by shewing their mutual dependence and rela tion as much as a poet who should make the anger of that hero the subject of hi. Not only in any limited portion of life a mans actions have a dependence on each other but also during the whole period of his duration from the cradle to the grave nor is it possible to strike oone link however minute in this regular chain without aecting the whole Textual Variants 179 5 Contrary to Aristotle a plot is not unitary as some suppose in virtue of being about one individual. For many indeed countless things happen to the individual from which there is no single outcome. Likewise many are the actions of an individual out of which no unitary action ensues. Poetics a 1519. The unity of action therefore which is to be found in biography or history diers from that of epic poetry not in kind but in degree. In epic poetry the connexion among the events is more close and sensible The narration is not carried on through such a length of time And the actors hasten to some remarkable period which satises the curiosity of the reader. This conduct of the epic poet depends on that particular situation of the Imagination and of the Passions which is supposed in that production. The imagination both of writer and reader is more enlivened and the passions more enamed than in history biography or any species of narration which conne themselves to strict truth and reality. Let us consider the eect of these two circumstances an enlivened imagination and enamed passion circumstances which belong to poetry especially the epic kind above any other species of composition And let us examine the reason why they require a stricter and closer unity in the fable. All poetry being a species of painting brings us nearer to the objects than any other species of narration throws a stronger light upon them and delineates more distinctly those minute circumstances which though to the historian they seem superuous serve mightily to enliven the imagery and gratify the fancy. If it be not necessary as in the Iliad to inform us each time the hero buckles his shoes and ties his garters it will be requisite perhaps to enter into a greater detail than in the Henriade where the events are run over with such rapidity that we scarcely have leisure to become acquainted with the scene or action. Were a poet therefore to comprehend in his subject any great compass of time or series of events and trace up the death of Hector to its remote causes in the rape of Helen or the judgment of Paris he must draw out his poem to an immeasurable length in order to ll this large canvas with just painting and imagery. The readers imagination enamed with such a series of poetical descriptions and his passions agitated by a contin ual sympathy with the actors must ag long before the period of the narration and must sink into lassitude and disgust from the repeated violence of the same movements. That an epic poet must not trace the causes to any great distance will farther appear if we consider another reason which is drawn from a property of the passions still more remarkable and singular. It is evident that in a just composition all the aections excited by the dierent events described and represented add mutual force to each other and that while the heroes are all engaged in one common scene and each action is strongly connected with the whole the concern is continually awake and the passions make an easy transition from one object to another. The strong connexion of the events as it facilitates the passage of the thought or imagination from one to another facilitates also the transfusion of the Textual Variants 180 passions and preserves the aections still in the same channel and direc tion. Our sympathy and concern for Eve prepares the way for a like sym pathy with Adam The aection is preserved almost entire in the transition and the mind seizes immediately the new object as strongly related to that which formerly engaged its attention. But were the poet to make a total digression from his subject and introduce a new actor nowise connected with the personages the imagination feeling a breach in the transition would enter coldly into the new scene would kindle by slow degrees and in returning to the main subject of the poem would pass as it were upon foreign ground and have its concern to excite anew in order to take part with the principal actors. The same inconvenience follows in a less degree where the poet traces his events to too great a distance and binds together actions which though not entirely disjoined have not so strong a connexion as is requisite to forward the transition of the passions. Hence arises the artice of the oblique narration employed in the Odyssey and Aeneid where the hero is introduced at rst near the period of his designs and afterwards shows us as it were in perspective the more distant events and causes. By this means the readers curiosity is immediately excited The events follow with rapidity and in a very close connexion And the concern is preserved alive and by means of the near relation of the objects continually increases from the beginning to the end of the narration. The same rule takes place in dramatic poetry nor is it ever permit ted in a regular composition to introduce an actor who has no connexion or but a small one with the principal personages of the fable. The spectators concern must not be diverted by any scenes disjoined and separated from the rest. This breaks the course of the passions and prevents that commu nication of the several emotions by which one scene adds force to another and transfuses the pity and terror which it excites upon each succeeding scene till the whole produces that rapidity of movement which is peculiar to the theatre. How must it extinguish this warmth of aection to be entertained on a sudden with a new action and new personages no wise related to the former to nd so sensible a breach or vacuity in the course of the passions by means of this breach in the connexion of ideas and instead of carrying the sympathy of one scene into the following to be obliged every moment to excite a new concern and take part in a new scene of action To return to the comparison of history and epic poetry we may conclude from the foregoing reasonings that as a certain unity is requisite in all productions it cannot be wanting in history more than in any other that in history the connexion among the several events which unites them into one body is the relation of cause and eect the same which takes place in epic poetry and that in the latter composition this connexion is Textual Variants 181 only required to be closer and more sensible on account of the lively imag ination and strong passions which must be touched by the poet in his nar ration. The Peloponnesian war is a proper subject for history the siege of Athens for an epic poem and the death of Alcibiades for a tragedy. As the dierence therefore between history and epic poetry consists only in the degrees of connexion which bind together those several events of which their subject is composed it will be dicult if not impossible by words to determine exactly the bounds which separate them from each other. That is a matter of taste more than of reasoning and perhaps this unity may often be discovered in a subject where at rst view and from an abstract consideration we should least expect to nd it. It is evident that Homer in the course of his narration exceeds the rst proposition of his subject and that the anger of Achilles which caused the death of Hector is not the same with that which pro duced so many ills to the Greeks. But the strong connexion between these two movements the quick transition from one to another the contrast 6 between the eects of concord and discord among the princes and the natural curiosity which we have to see Achilles in action after so long a repose all these causes carry on the reader and produce a sucient unity in the subject. It may be objected to Milton that he has traced up his causes to too great a distance and that the rebellion of the angels produces the fall of man by a train of events which is both very long and very casual. Not to mention that the creation of the world which he has related at length is no more the cause of that catastrophe than of the battle of Pharsalia or any other event that has ever happened. But if we consider on the other hand that all these events the rebellion of the angels the creation of the world and the fall of man resemble each other in being miraculous and out of the common course of nature that they are supposed to be contiguous in time and that being detached from all other events and being the only original facts which revelation discovers they strike the eye at once and naturally recall each other to the thought or imagination If we consider all these circumstances I say we shall nd that these parts of the action have a sucient unity to make them be comprehended in one fable or narration. To which we may add that the rebellion of the angels and the fall of man have a peculiar resemblance as being counterparts to each other and pre senting to the reader the same moral of obedience to our Creator. Textual Variants 182 6 Contrast or contrariety is a connexion among ideas which may perhaps be consid ered as a mixture of causation and resemblance. Where two objects are contrary the one destroys the other i.e. This note was reworded in the edition and moved to the third paragraph of the section. These loose hints I have thrown together in order to excite the curiosity of philosophers and beget a suspicion at least if not a full persuasion that this subject is very copious and that many operations of the human mind depend on the connexion or association of ideas which is here explained. Particularly the sympathy between the passions and imagination will perhaps appear remarkable while we observe that the aections excited by one object pass easily to another object connected with it but transfuse themselves with diculty or not at all along dierent objects which have no manner of connexion together. By introduc ing into any composition personages and actions foreign to each other an injudicious author loses that communication of emotions by which alone he can interest the heart and raise the passions to their proper height and period. The full explication of this principle and all its consequences would lead us into reasonings too profound and too copious for this enquiry. It is sucient at present to have established this conclusion that the three connecting principles of all ideas are the relations of Resemblance Contiguity and Causation.

Hume sent this text to his printer William Strahan with a letter dated 26 October see Appendix IV p. 68 which indicates that the two writers he had mainly in mind were Thomas Reid and James Beattie see under Scottish CommonSense Philosophers in the Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers and Philosophical Movements. SECTION I 1.1 Moral philosophy moral is here used in the common eighteenthcentury sense meaning related to the human sphere rather than in the more usual modern sense of ethics. Hence Humes equation of moral philos ophy with the science of human nature. .1 two dierent manners Hume goes on to distinguish two dierent styles of philosophy the easy and the abstruse see 8 of the Introduction above. .2 his understanding understanding here is a noun rather than a verb referring to a human faculty of the mind. In this sense the understanding is another name for the faculty of reasonwhereby we discover truths which was standardly distinguished from the willwhereby we form desires and intentions. See also explanatory notes to 2.1 and to the Textual Variant to 1.14 p. .3 plebeian a common or ordinary person deriving from the Roman social class distinction between patricians who were from noble families and plebeians or plebs. LOCKE Hume identies Aristotle Malebranche and Locke as abstruse philosophers Cicero La Bruyre and Addison as more popu lar easy philosophers. For Aristotle Malebranche Locke and Cicero see Glossarial Index for more information. Jean de la Bruyre 96 was a French author writing principally on moral issues. Joseph Addison was an English essayist and politician best known today for having founded The Spectator magazine 12 with Richard Steele. .6 Abstruse though . . In the conclu sion of Book I of his Treatise of Human Nature Hume nds himself reduced by sceptical anxieties to the most deplorable condition imagi nable T 1.4.7.8 while in My Own Life he famously describes the Treatise as having fallen deadborn from the press Appendix V p. 70 an allusion to Popes Epilogue on the Satires Dialogue ii All all but truth drops deadborn from the press. .6 Be a philosophe . . But it is nature that seems to say this and Hume will spend most of the remainder of Section I arguing the contrary case in favour of abstruse philosophy at least when it is practised properly. .8 pictures an easy philosopher is here thought of as like a painter paint ing a picture of human life to whom accurate knowledge of human nature can be serviceable i.e. .8 a VENUS or an HELEN Venus the Roman goddess of lovealso known by the Greek name Aphroditewas judged by Paris prince of Troy an ancient city of Anatolia to be the most beautiful of the goddesses. In return Venus gave him the love of Helen of Sparta wife of King Menelaus and the worlds most beautiful woman. This was the origin of the Trojan War in which the Greek forces led by Agamemnon of Mycenae the brother of Menelaus besieged Troy and ultimately destroyed it. After ten years of failure the Greeks gained entrance to the city through the famous ruse of the Trojan Horse devised by Odysseus or Ulysses a wooden horse seemingly left as a peace oering on their departure but within which Greek soldiers were hidden. .11 popular superstitions here superstition is used in a general sense to cover irrational religious beliefs. The word also has a more specic sense associated with magic and ritualism in this sense it was common for Roman Catholicism to be described by its enemies as superstition see 5 of the Introduction above. .12 too sensible an interest too strong a motive. Sensible in this eighteenth century usage does not mean showing good sense but instead apparent to the senses or feeling. People who exploit dubious metaphysics for personal gain e.g. .12 catholic remedy general cure. .12 careless carefree unconcerned not taking great care. .13 mental geography systematic description of supercial behaviour of the mind as opposed to discovery of the secret springs and principles Notes to Pages 59 186 1.15the underlying causesthat are responsible for that behaviour. See 8 of the Introduction above. .14 the compass of human understanding the range of human rational enquiry the phrase was used by John Locke in his Essay IV. .14 intimately concerned in the rst two editions of the Enquiry and a note appeared at this point crediting Francis Hutcheson and Joseph Butler with important insights see Textual Variants above pp. 778 and also p. .15 secret springs and principles the underlying causes of the behaviour of the human mind. Humes comparison with astronomy in these two para graphs indicates that mental geography can be a very sophisticated activity analogous to the work of Kepler in systematizing the motion of the planets. Discovery of secret springs and principles is ascribed only to Newtons monumental synthesis and applying this analogy back to Humes work suggests that his own discoveriessuch as the identication of custom as a central feature of human inference will come under the heading of mental geography. The Enquiry thus seems to show less ambition than the Treatise which had suggested that the association of ideas is a fundamental force analogous to gravitation 1.1.4.6. .15 Till a philosopher an allusion to Isaac Newton see Glossarial Index. SECTION II 2.0 the ORIGIN of IDEAS Hume follows the pattern of Lockes Essay by starting his investigation into the human understanding with the question of where our ideas come from. Their answer to this is often thought to represent the key dierence between rationalists and empiricists see pp. 236 and as in the Treatise 1.1.1.4 Humes Copy Principle 2.5 puts him in the empiricist camp with Locke denying innate ideas cf. In Book I of the Treatise Humes discussion then continues forward with the same Lockean agenda asking how we acquire our various ideas of the memory and imagination of relations abstractions space and time causation body the self etc. In the Enquiry by contrast Hume soon turns to the very dierent issue of how we acquire information about the world focusing on the role of factual inference Section IV. Only after establishing that this intimately involves the idea of causation and hence necessary connexion does he come back to considering the origin of that one specic idea in Section VII before returning again to epistemological questions for most of the rest of the Enquiry. .1 perceptions of the mind Hume uses the term perceptions for what Descartes and Locke had called ideas and then draws his own distinc tion within the category of such perceptions between ideas and impressions. See 9 of the Introduction above. Notes to Pages 912 187 2.1 These faculties in addition to the very broad distinction between the understanding or reason and the will see explanatory note to 1.2 Hume also sometimes refers to other faculties of the mind notably the senses sight touch etc. Talk of such faculties does not imply that they correspond to real divisions within the mind indeed John Locke was emphatic that making such an assumption would be a mistake Essay II. Humes own usage of the terms is accordingly rather exible particularly in respect of reason or the understanding and its boundary with the imagination though he is most explicit about this in the Treatise e.g. .3 force and vivacity it is unclear whether Hume intends to dene the dis tinction between impressions and ideas in terms of force and vivacity or whether this is simply an attempt to capture the dierence between sensations or feelings and thoughts cf. .5 all our idea . . See 9 of the Introduction above. .7 a LAPLANDER or NEGROE Lapland is an Arctic region of northern Scandinavia a negro is someone with dark skin typically of African origin. In Humes day very few people from these places would have experienced the taste of wine. .8 one contradictory phaenomenon Hume now presents his puzzling example of the missing shade of blue which seems to show that the simple ideas are not alway . . He does not seem to be particularly disturbed by the apparent counter example to his Copy Principle perhaps for the reason suggested in the Introduction p. .9 from wha . . He will use this principle in Section VII to inves tigate the meaning of terms such as power force energy or necessary connexion 7.3. SECTION III 3.0 ASSOCIATION of IDEAS John Locke Essay II. 7 like other philosophers had criticized the association of ideas as irrational and even akin to madness because it determines the train of our thoughts not by reason but instead on the basis of chance or of custom i.e. Hume aims to overturn this traditional view by showing Notes to Pages 1216 188 in Sections IV and V that all factual reasoning depends on custom so that without it we could never learn anything beyond the reach of our memory and senses. .3 possible 6 note 5 in Beauchamps numbering system relates to text omit ted from the edition please see Note on the Text p.

Perhaps the most famous example of a proposition demonstrated by Euclid is Pythagoras Theorem that in any rightangled triangle the square of the hypotenuse the side opposite the right angle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sidesso for example a triangle whose sides are of lengths 3 4 and 5 metres will be rightangled since 32 42 52 cf. .2 The contrar . . The Principle has already been anticipated at 2.4 and will occur again at 4.18. .6 reasonings priori reasonings are a priori if they do not rely on any empirical information e.g. However Humes interest here is on what if anything can be inferred from our observations. So he uses the term priori in a slightly dierent way to mean inference which does not rely on any remembered empirical informa tion as opposed to immediate observation. See 10 of the Introduction. .6 ADAM according to Genesis the rst book of the Hebrew Bible Adam was the rst man created by God.

See 2 of the Introduction above. .10 may I not conceive it might seem that Hume is appealing to his Conceivability Principle 4.2 here to establish only that other eects are logically possible. However he is claiming much more that a priori many dierent eects are equally possible with no basis for choosing between them so that the choice between them would be entirely arbitrary 4.9. .12 reduce the principle . . See 7 of the Introduction above. It is in this unifying spirit that he will later sketch some hypotheses of his own in the science of mind arguing that custom is analogous to the association of ideas 5.20 and that it can account for probabilistic inference 6.3.

Hume here indicates that his language of powers should not be taken to prejudge how that language is to be interpreted. Notes to Pages 2024 190 4.16 a medium a middle term in an inference connecting the premisses with the conclusion. We have now reached the heart of Humes famous sceptical argument concerning induction outlined in 11 of the Introduction above. Having shown that all factual arguments depend on a supposition of uniformity he is now asking what basis there could be for such a supposition. It cannot be founded on what we perceive nor is it known to be true by immediate intuition hence Hume deduces that it could only be well founded if it is inferable by reasoning that involves at least one intermediate stepsome medium. See explanatory note to 4.21. .18 moral reasoning in the rst two editions of the Enquiry Hume refers here to moral or probable Reasonings. The term is used by Hume to mean reasoning which is less than perfectly certain delivering probability or at best moral certainty and the word moral carries no connotation of ethical relevance. See 10 of the Introduction above. .18 demonstrative arguments arguments that lead with total logical certainty from premisses to conclusion such as valid arguments in mathematics. See 10 of the Introduction above. .19 experimental conclusions things inferred on the basis of experience. .20 I cannot imagin . . However it is doubtful whether such inference could provide a solution to Humes socalled Problem of Induction because statistical inference depends on the assumption that the observed sample is representative or randomly chosen and this cannot be guaranteed when inferring from past to future. .21 the interposing ideas an allusion to Lockes Essay IV. which spoke of intermediate Ideas as forming a chain of inference from premiss to conclusion constituting either a demonstrative or a probable argument depending on the strength of the links. SECTION V 5.1 EPICTETUS and other Stoics see Glossarial Index. .1 ACADEMIC or SCEPTICAL philosophy see Glossarial Index. .3 into this world Hume briey summarizes the sceptical argument of Section IV starting with the Adam thoughtexperiment. .5 CUSTOM or HABIT see 11 of the Introduction above. As Hume goes on to explain all he is doing here is giving a name to a causal principle of human nature that he has observed to be operative. We do in fact make factual inferences in response to repeated experience though he has shown that all such inferences involve a stepnamely the supposition of uniformity 5.2that cannot be founded on reason. Reason does not engage us to make that step but we evidently make it nonetheless so it Notes to Pages 2532 191 is apparently a basic fact about human nature that we function in this way. It is a form of habituation in response to repetition hence habit seems an appropriate name for this principle of human nature. But Hume usually prefers the term custom which Locke had used see explanatory note to 3.0 though with highly negative connotations which Hume reverses. .6 Custom then is the great guide of human life Hume pointedly echoes Bishop Joseph Butlers famous phrase in the introduction to his Analogy of Religion that Probability is the very guide of life. He agrees with Butler on the importance of probable or factual reasoning our only means of discovering anything about the world. However such reason ing does not dependas Locke and Butler had assumedon any type of rational insight into why things must or are likely to behave uniformly. Instead it depends on custom an instinctive principle of human nature that just leads us to assume that they will do so. .8 What the . . .8 It is an operation of the soul Hume emphasizes that custom is involun tary and instinctive at its most basic level not subject to rational control. Soul here is just another word for mind with no religious connotation intended. .9 the remainin . . .12 Were we t . .

Rackham Loeb Why are we more aected asked Piso when we learn that the places we see were often frequented by famous men than we are when we hear a report of the same mens exploits or read a written account of them Is it a natural endowment we have or is it some sort of aberration I feel the eect now for example. For I am put in mind of Plato who we are told was the rst to practice dis putation here indeed the adjoining gardens not only bring him back to mind but seem to place the man himself before my eyes. Here is Speusippus here Xenocrates and here his follower Polemo The bench we see over there was Polemos. In the same way even when looking at our own senate buildingI mean the Hostilia not the new building which looks slighter to me since it was enlargedI used to think of Notes to Pages 3238 192 Scipio Cato Laelius and especially my grandfather. So great is the suggestive power of places that it is no accident that they shape our memory training. .20 the belie . . But he rst points out a dierence custom leads to new beliefs whereas the three principles operate to enliven thoughts about things that we already believe to exist. .21 preestablished harmony a notion associated with the great German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz who advocated a worldview having some resemblance to occasionalism cf. of the Introduction above. Leibniz agreed with Malebranche in denying any actual causation between objects but whereas Malebranche saw their apparent interaction as eected by God on each occasion Leibniz attributed this instead to the selfcontained behaviour of each object acting quite independently but all choreographed in advance by God to act in a preestablished harmony. Humes comment evinces some amusement at the parallel between Leibnizs highly theological theory and his own naturalistic view. .21 final causes explanation of change by reference to purposes or goals. The term is associated with Aristotle who attributed the motion of objects to their striving to reach their natural place in the cosmos see 12 of the Introduction above. Again Humes comment is not to be taken too seriously. SECTION VI 6.0 n. 0 demonstrations proofs and probabilities see 12 of the Introduction above. .1 no such thin . . But in this section he will argue that ignorance of underlying causes leaves us relying on probability just as if the relevant events e.g. .3 an inexplicabl . . Hume is not claiming to give any precise explanation of this something of a contrast to Treatise 1.3.1112 but will now suggest that it can per haps in some measure be accounted for given the similarity. Notes to Pages 3943 193 SECTION VII 7.0 Of the IDE . . CONNEXION in the rst two editions of the Enquiry and the Title of Section VII was Of the Idea of Power or necessary Connexion. Throughout the section Hume treats power and connexion as virtual synonyms as he had done also in the corre sponding section of the Treatise where he explains that the terms of ecacy agency power force energy necessity connexion and productive quality are all nearly synonimous T 1.3.14.4. .2 EUCLID see explanatory note to 4.1. .2 chimera and conceit both terms refer to something imagined and fanciful in Greek mythology a chimera is a monster with a lions head a goats body and a snakes tail. .4 all our ideas. . . .5 let us searc . . LOCKE see Glossarial Index the reference is to Lockes Essay II. 2 simple idea Hume makes the assumption that the idea whose impression he seeks is simple as apparent also at 7.4.

It refers to the practice used by some classical playwrights of resolving a plot often rather implausibly through the intervention of a god lowered onto the stage by a mechanism. .21 many philosophers Hume refers to Malebranche and other occasionalists. See Glossarial Index and 6 of the Introduction. .29 we may define a cause on Humes famous two denitions see pp. In dening a cause Hume is acknowledging that the notion is a legitimate one despite any impression to the contrary that his arguments might have given. Treatise 1.4.5.32 provides perhaps the Notes to Pages 4456 194 most explicit statement of this all objects which are found to be con stantly conjoind are upon that account only to be regarded as causes and eects. SECTION VIII 8.2 liberty and necessity see the Introduction 14 for a discussion of Humes treatment of this topic and 4 for some background.

If I give someone access to a bank vault because they threaten my family with a gun then in this sense I do so freely because I act intentionally according to the determinations of my willin unlocking the door. But Humes approach can easily accommodate the commonsense idea that I am not blameworthy for doing so. If I am blameless for opening the vault this is not because I did not act freely. Rather it is because I did not do anything wrong. In that situation faced with the alternatives of opening the vault or having my family murdered opening the vault was not a blameworthy act. .25 nothing exist . . .26 consistent with morality in the nal and editions of the Enquiry morality replaced Morality and Religion.

The opponent Hume is imagining here is advocating libertarianism by insisting that liberty i.e. The libertarian maintains that we cannot be genuinely free in the sense appropriate to moral responsibility unless we are undetermined. Typically the compatibilist will reply as Hume does that undetermined behaviour is merely random and hence not morally accountable.

Humes argument against miracles is structurally parallel in rst reducing the evidence of testimony to experience and then arguing that this experiential evidence in favour of testimony can never out weigh the strength of the experience against a miracle. 0.3 moral evidence evidence that is less than certain typically deriving from experience of cause and eectsee explanatory note to 4.18. 0.4 a wis . .

He died young weakened by rigorous fasting and mortication e.g. While the body was on display parts of his nails hair and clothes were taken as relics and an elderly woman who kissed his feet was supposedly cured of a paralysed arm. The celebrity of this miracle brought crowds of sick people to his tomb with the results that Hume describes. Abb Paris supported the theology of Cornelius Jansen Bishop of Ypres whose posthumous book Augustinus emphasized divine grace and strict predestination see the Introduction p. In France the rise of the Jansenists provoked intense dispute with the Jesuits see explanatory note below whom they accused of moral laxity and Pelagianism the heresy that man can earn salvation through good works. The controversy was suciently erce to provoke three papal decrees against Jansenism in an. The last of these Unigenitus was issued by Pope Clement XI under pressure from the French king Louis XIV keen to insist on theological unity to promote the unity of the state. Humes focus on Jansenism may be motivated by the thought that both Protestants and orthodox Roman Catholics would be opposed to it so the vast major ity of his readers can be expected to favour a sceptical attitude towards the Jansenist miracles. 0.27 Jesuits members of the Society of Jesus founded by Ignatius Loyola a Roman Catholic order committed to serving the Pope Notes to Pages 8890 200 and noted for its intellectual orientation and for its commitment to educa tion and missionary work.

STATE in the rst edition of this section was entitled Of the Practical Consequences of Natural Religion which Hume perhaps came to think was too pointed since the conclusion of the section is that natural religion the attempt to establish religious conclusions by appeal to the nature of the worldhas no practical consequences whatever. The changed Title focuses on the notion of Gods particular providence towards individuals as opposed to His general providence in establishing benecial laws of nature and Christians hope for a future state that is an afterlife in heaven. It is striking in view of the latter that Hume omits the powerful arguments against immortality that he put in his suppressed essay on the topic see Appendix II above. 1.1 he advance . .

SOCRATES Protagoras c.485410 bc was the rst of the ancient Greek Sophists most famous for his advocacy of rela tivism i.e. He was banished from Athens for heretically questioning the existence of the Greek gods. Socrates 469399 bc Platos teacher and reputedly one of the greatest philosophers of antiquity was convicted of impiety and corrupting the youth of Athens through his teaching. His punishment was to commit suicide by drinking hemlock as famously recorded in Platos Phaedo. EPICUREANS see Glossarial Index. The footnoted reference is to Lucian cf. 1.2 the wisest o . .

In Humes appli cation for the Chair of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh was vetoed by the Town Council under pressure from the Church. Humes sceptical friend now argues that a wise magistrate should tolerate irreligious speculation since such speculation does not really have its alleged pernicious consequences being instead entirely indierent to the peace of society and security of government.

SECTION XII 12.1 Atheists in the Enquiry Hume never overtly expresses support for atheism though a hint might be detectable here in his association of atheism with scepticism cf. By far the best evidence for Humes atheism is the general tendency of his arguments especially in Sections VIII X and XI of the Enquiry Of the Immortality of the Soul The Natural History of Religion and the Dialogues concerning Natural Religion. For a brief review of this evidence see chapter 1 3 in my Reading Hume on Human Understanding OU. 2.3 scepticism antecedent see 18 of the Introduction above for an outline of Humes discussion of the varieties of scepticism. 2.3 DES CARTES see Glossarial Index. 2.3 diffident mistrustful lacking condence. 2.4 education or rash opinion the word education often in Hume carries connotations of indoctrination. 2.6 the evidence of sense scepticism with regard to the senses is covered in far greater detail in Treatise 1.4.2 but with a very dierent focus. The Enquirys argument is summarized in the Introduction above pp. 2.10 cavils quibbling arguments. Notes to Pages 98111 203 12.13 a very unexpected circuit Descartes famously appealed to Gods nondeceitfulness in order to establish the ultimate reliability of our faculties if used properly. 2.15 another sceptical topic this argument broadly follows that of Treatise 1.4.4 Of the modern philosophy. 2.15 merely secondary Lockes distinction between primary and secondary qualities against which Hume here deploys an argument of Berkeleys is discussed in 3 of the Introduction above. For Locke and Berkeley see also Glossarial Index. 2.15 Abstraction Locke appealed to the notion of abstraction to explain the origin of general ideas see the Introduction p. 2.15 Isoceles nor Scalenum an isosceles triangle is one that has two sides the same length while a scalene triangles sides are all of dierent lengths. Berkeley Principles of Human Knowledge Introduction 13 famously took advantage of Lockes confused description of the abstract idea of a triangle in Essay IV. to ridicule his notion of abstraction. 2.16 no scepti . . Hume appears to be dismissive of the notion of a certain unknown inexplicable something as the cause of our perceptions but rather than reject the notion as incoherent he seems to suggest that it is suciently thin to be harmless. No dubious metaphysics e.g. 2.21 Pyrrhonism see Glossarial Index. 2.22 more profound researches Hume now summarizes his own argument from Section IV Sceptical doubts concerning the operations of the under standing incorporating also the lesson from Section VII cf. He highlights the sceptical worry that the instinct of custom like other instincts may be fallacious and deceitful. For an overview of Humes strategy at this point in Section XII see the Introduction p. 2.23 COPERNICAN or PTOLEMAIC see 1 of the Introduction above. 2.23 STOIC or EPICUREAN see Glossarial Index. 2.24 result of this PYRRHONISM since the arguments for Pyrrhonism are supposed to be irrefutable Hume seems to be suggesting that it results in mitigated scepticism by a natural causal route rather than rational reection. If we reect on the Pyrrhonian arguments then we will naturally nd ourselves drawn towards mitigated scepticism even when common life renders the Pyrrhonian arguments impossible to believe. 2.25 limitation of our enquiries see the extract from the Dialogues Appendix III above for Cleanthes doubts about the cogency of this recommendation. 2.25 methodized and corrected see pp. Notes to Pages 112118 204 12.27 As the componen . . 2.27 the square of the hypothenuse this result is known as Pythagoras Theorem see explanatory note to 4.1. 2.28 CAESAR Julius Caesar 10044 bc became dictator of Rome by defeating his rivals in the rst Triumvirate and hence ended the Republic. His murder by Brutus and Cassius intended to restore the Republic led to a second civil war in which Octavian triumphed to become the rst Roman emperor under the name Augustus cf. Hume refers to Caesars famous book The Gallic War in various places and takes his existence as a paradigm example of a fact securely established by moral evidence e.g. 2.28 the angel GABRIEL best known from the New Testament book of Luke 1 2638 where as Gods messenger he informs Mary about the forth coming birth of Jesus. In making reference to Gabriel Hume is clearly hinting at a more signicant Application of his principle namely that the nonexistence of God Himself is perfectly conceivable and implies no contradiction. Hence any attempt to prove the existence of God a priori e.g. 2.29 It is only experience Hume here repeats his result about our knowledge of causation from 4.11. In the context of the previous sentence he also seems to be hinting at a corollary that any causal argument for Gods existence must be founded entirely on causal principles established by experience. This cripples any attempt to argue beyond what is manifest in experience as already demonstrated in Section XI and hence any form of the socalled Cosmological Argument. 2.32 But its bes . . Hume suggests that Divinit . . So divinity is not supported by experience at all. Note also the fate of books of divinity at 12.34. Hume grounds both morality and aesthetics on sentiment rather than reasonsee the Introduction p. 2.34 Commit it then to the flames Burning had long been a common fate of atheistic books. Perhaps Hume is suggesting here that the wrong books have been destroyed bearing in mind that Section XII started with a comment on atheism. Notes to Pages 119120 205 HUMES ENDNOTES a LOCKE John Locke see Glossarial Index devoted Book I of his famous Essay to an attack on Innate Notions and is clearly the main philosopher Hume has in mind amongst those who denied innate ideas. B TIBERIU . . NERO Roman emperors reigning ad 1437 and 5468 respectively famed for their immorality and abuse of power. D vis inertiae the supposed force of inertia that makes a body resistant to change and hence gives it a tendency to remain in a uniform state of rest or motion until acted upon by an active force. In the Treatise by contrast he conned his attention to relations between types of specic events rather than variable interactions mediated by mathematical relationships. This change might explain the contrast between T 1.3.15 and E 9.5 endnot. Sir ISAAC NEWTO . . Hume seems in this endnote to be distinguishing between Newton and his followers presumably so as to refuse them the great authority of his name. Second causes are causes in nature as opposed to Gods own power but some of those inuenced by Newton embraced occasionalism denying that anything but God has genuine ecacy see also pp. DES CARTE . . LOCKE see Glossarial Index. CLARKE and CUDWORTH Samuel Clarke was an English theologian and philosopher best known at the time for his Boyle Lectures in defence of Christianity and today for his correspondence with Leibniz cf. Clarkes popular Cosmological Argument for Gods existence is thought likely to be the model for the similar argument advanced by Demea and refuted by Cleanthes in Part IX of Humes Dialogues concerning Natural Religion. Ralph Cudworth 88 was leader of the Cambridge Platonists in its day an inuential group of whom Henry More 87 was also a prominent member. Attracted by Descartess dualism and also his mechanical philosophy Cudworth adopted a combination of mechanistic atomism and Platonic metaphysics which he believed to have originated with Moses and been transmitted to the Greeks by Pythagoras. The principal target of his arguments was Hobbes against whom he sought both to refute deter minism as applied to human action and to establish the eternal truth of morality as depending on Platonic ideas rather than the Hobbesian state. His daughter Damaris as Lady Masham was a close friend of Locke and corresponded with Leibniz. Notes to Pages 121124 206 E The dispute Hume here alludes to the vis viva controversy in which Leibniz maintained that the force of a body in motion should be measured as its mass multiplied by the square of its velocity. The Newtonians such as Samuel Clarke instead preferred to use momentum i.e. As seen from a modern perspective both views reected a partial truth on the one hand the law of conservation of momentum and on the other the law of conservation of energy in which the kinetic energy of a moving body is proportional to Leibnizs vis viva. Conservation of momentum governs all collisions and gravitational interactions but is of little use in ascer taining the ight of projectiles since changes in the Earths momentum are unmeasurable. Conservation of kinetic energy applies only to fully elastic collisions in which energy is not dissipated as heat but is of much greater use for calculating motion under gravity. As to the frequent this note was absent in the edition of the Enquiry and in the edition its nal paragraph was much shorter a Cause is dierent from a Sign as it implies Precedency and Contiguity in Time and Place as well as Constant Conjunction. A Sign is nothing but a correlative Eect from the same Cause. H We shall here this discussion is the closest that remains in the Enquiry to Treatise 1.3.15 Rules by which to judge of causes and eects. See explanatory note to endnot. le Mons. MONTGERON LouisBasile Carr de Montgeron himself a Jansenist cf. He delivered a copy of the book to Louis XV King of France at the Palace of Versailles at the same time warning against the Pope and the Jesuits political power. For this he was later arrested under authority of the lieu tenant of police Ren Hrault who attempted to suppress the Jansenist supporters of Abb Paris. Recueil des Miracles de lAbb PARIS book written anonymously and presented by twentythree priests to the archbishop of Paris on 13 Augus. The Recueil was meanwhile published but the archbishop did not respond prompting twentytwo priests to send another formal request for investigation on 4 Octobe. This decree prompted a major controversy with many books and pamphlets on each side. Noailless successor Archbishop Vintimille of Aix supported the Pope and assisted Hrault in pursuing Jansenists. Madamoiselle le FRANC Molinism the theological system of the Spanish Jesuit Luis de Molina was strongly Notes to Pages 124128 207 supported by the French Jesuits in opposition to the predestinarian Jansenists cf. of the Introduction above. It claims that human choice is entirely free and undetermined but that nevertheless God knows in advance what any possible person would do in any possible cir cumstances. This counterfactual middle knowledge enables Him to arrange things providentially by deciding which possibilities to actualize without infringing the freedom of those individuals He decides to create. Anne le Franc was supposedly cured of blindness and paralysis after oering prayers to Abb Paris. DE SYLVA the reported healing of Marguerite Thibault was attested by Montgeron and the Recueil and investigated by the physician JeanBaptiste Silva on Hraults instructions. PAUL the biblical book of Joshua 6 120 reports that the walls of the besieged city of Jericho collapsed in response to the sounding of rams horn trumpets on divine instructions. The Israelites under Joshua then slaughtered virtually everyone in the city and even the animals in accordance with the extreme genocidal policy prescribed by God in Deuteronomy 7 2 20 1617. According to the Acts of the Apostles 16 256 an earthquake shook the prison where St Paul and his companion Silas were held opening all the doors and unfastening the chains. Duc de CHATILLON Paul Sigismond de Montmorency mentioned in the published Recueil. PORTROYAL the Abbey of PortRoyal near Paris became during thes a centre for Jansenism through the inuence of Jean Duvergier de Hauranne the main proponent of French Jansenism. Its teaching and textbooks became renowned in particular Logic or The Art of Thinking by Antoine Arnauld 94 and Pierre Nicole 95 widely known as the PortRoyal Logic which presented a Cartesian approach to Aristotelian logic. With the nal suppression of Jansenism by the French King Louis XIV and the Pope the community of Port Royal was forcibly dispersed i. Shortly afterwards the buildings were destroyed and even the corpses in the cemetary dug up to be thrown into a nearby common grave. PASCAL Blaise Pascal 62 a notable mathematician and theolo gian was a frequent visitor to PortRoyal where from his sister Jacqueline was a nun. He is now most famed for Pascals Wager his notorious suggestion that belief in God is justiable on pragmatic grounds even if the evidence is very poor by weighing up the prospective posthumous benets of belief i.e. RACINE Jean Racine 99 educated at PortRoyal was one of the most celebrated seventeenthcentury French dramatists along with Notes to Page 129 208 Molire and Corneille. His Abrg de lhistoire de PortRoyal reports this miracle of the holy thorn by which Pascals niece Marguerite Prier was cured of an ulcerated eye through the Application of a thorn supposedly from the crown of thorns worn by Jesus. Flix to investigate the alleged miracle. He returned convinced but she refrained from any public statement so as to avoid theological controversy. N Dr. BAYLE for Berkeley see Glossarial Index. Pierre Bayle was a French Protestant author best known for his Dictionnaire historique et critiqu. Bayles Dictionary is particu larly notable for its collection of sceptical arguments which Hume acknowledged using as a source for his Treatise of Human Nature. However Bayle unlike Hume was a deist undermining reason only to make room for faith. As such he may be the model or at least a partial model for the character of Philo in Humes Dialogues concerning Natural Religion who appears to advocate deism towards the end of the work. O mathematical points indivisible points without any extension. Ask a Mathematician what he means when he pronounces two Quantities to be equal and he must say that the Idea of Equality is one of those which cannot be dend and that tis sucient to place two equal Quantities before any one in order to suggest it. Now this is an Appeal to the general Appearance of Objects to the Imagination or Senses and consequently can never aord Conclusions so directly con trary to these Faculties. P particula . . Q Ex nihilo nihil fit most commonly rendered as nothing comes from nothing hence anything that exists must have a cause of its existence. Hume famously discussed this causal maxim in Treatise 1.3.3 concluding that it could not be proved intuitively or demonstratively Notes to Pages 129131 209 though he evinced both there and in other sources a belief in the maxim as based on experience. TEXTUAL VARIANTS Section I note to 1.14 n. Hutcheson Francis Hutcheson Professor of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow University who inuentially attributed moral judgements to a moral sense analogous to our perception of secondary qualities such as colours and tastes. He was keen to insist against Hobbes that humans do not always act selshly but have natural feelings of benevolence. Hence benecial actions bring pleasure and approval which is the source of the moral sense. Hutcheson applied a similar theory to aesthetics and it seems likely that his approach inuenced the young Hume in at least these elds. Norman Kemp Smiththe most notable Hume scholar of the early twentieth century speculated that the inuence went even deeper and that Hutcheson might have inspired the central thrust of Humes philosophy that even in epistemology we must rely on feeling rather than rational perception. Section I of Hutchesons Illustrations upon the Moral Sense men tions the common Division of the Faculties of the Soul. According to this taxonomy Reason and Will are primary with the Senses subordi nate to Reason and the Passions to the Will. Reasons role is to present the natures and relations of things antecedently to any Act of Will or Desire which corresponds well to Humes description of it in this note as That Faculty by which we discern Truth and Falshood cf. See Butlers Sermons Joseph Butler theologian and Anglican bishop best known for The Analogy of Religion of which Hume thought highly despite his disagreements. Hume was anxious to win Butlers good opinion and for this reason removed his most contentious religious claims from the Treatise see pp. The note to Butler alludes to the argument stressed in his Sermon XI on Romans 13 9 Upon the Love of our Neighbour though Humes interpretation of interested puts it somewhat paradoxically. The central point is that in acting selshly one acts to satisfy some desire perhaps for food riches personal success companionship anothers wellbeing or whateverand that selsh action therefore presupposes some desire other than pure selfinterest. Therefore it is impossible to reduce all desires to selfinterest indeed selfinterest depends upon having other more basic desires. These more basic desires can perfectly well be benevolent as well as selfdirected indeed both Butler and Hume are emphatic that humans are naturally inclined towards fellow feeling with others and hence concern for their wellbeing.

MAJOR PHILOSOPHERS AND PHILOSOPHICAL MOVEMENTS HUMES thought in the Enquiry draws on knowledge of a wide range of classical and modern thinkers whose views are often closely interrelated and therefore most easily assimilated in combination. The summaries below are intended to facilitate this while also providing an aidememoire and an organ ized catalogue of Humes references to other philosophers within the text of the Enquiry. Aristotle and the Medieval Schools Aristotle 384322 bc is widely considered the greatest philosopher of antiquity making seminal contributions in the philosophy of logic and language metaphysics aesthetics ethics and politics as well as develop ing inuential theories of physics psychology and biology. A pupil of Plato in the Academy see below he went on to be tutor to Alexander the Great of Macedonia and in 355 bc founded his own school near Athens at the Lyceum. For discussion of his theory of the world and its long inuence see 1 of the Introduction above. By medieval times the pagan schools of philosophy had been suppressed and Aristotelianism incorp orated into a Christian framework was so dominant that it was often referred to as simply the philosophy of the schools with Aristotle him self known as the Philosopher. Nevertheless the Philosophers own works were not always taken as uniquely authoritative and some of the most inuential elements of the medieval synthesis were later developments of Aristotelianism such as Ptolemys system of the heavens and Galens medicine. Aristotle is mentioned twice in the main text of the Enquiry an example of an abstract reasoner whose fame is utterly decayed 1.4 and whose theory of the elements is antiquated 8.7. Aristotles theory of literary criticism also gets a mention in the long deleted passage from Section III 3.10 variant. The medieval schools are mentioned twice in Section VIII 8.22 endnote 8.27 and schoolmen at 2.9 endnot. Most famously at the end of the Enquiry Aristotelian school metaphysics typies the sort of philosophy that is to be committed to the ames 12.34. Pyrrhonian and Academic Scepticism Pyrrho of Elis c.365270 bc was the bestknown sceptic of antiquity who supposedly had to be accompanied by friends for his own safety since Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers 221 he saw no reason for believing that carts precipices or wild animals would do him harm. He wrote nothing himself and the works of his followers like those of most ancient philosophers other than Plato and Aristotle were suppressed during the early Christian era. Their arguments were preserved chiey through the compendious Outlines of Pyrrhonism by Sextus Empiricus a Greek of the third century ad which was rediscov ered in the sixteenth century and had a major inuence in casting doubt on the medieval consensus. Descartess pivotal use of sceptical arguments to dismiss anything that cannot be perceived clearly and distinctly to be true including the established philosophy of the medieval schools can probably be traced to the rediscovery of Sextus. Plato 427347 bc was one of the preeminent philosophers of antiquity particularly inuential through his founding of the Academy at Athens and also in later years because Neoplatonism proved amenable to incorp oration within Christianity most notably through Augustine of Hippo ad 354430. In the centuries after Plato under Arcesilaus c.315242 bc Carneades c.213129 bc and others his Academy became synonymous with sceptical thought although Academic scepticism was generally less radical than that of the Pyrrhonians accepting that some things are more probable than others even if all are uncertain. These ideas were preserved into the modern era principally through the writings of Marcus Tullius Cicero a Roman who briey studied at the Academy and was also inuenced by Stoicism see below. It is debatable how far Humes characterization of Pyrrhonian scepti cism is faithful to its historical sources. He draws a contrast between excessive Pyrrhonian scepticism 12.21 12.235 which he understands as involving a denial of all belief and mitigated Academic scepticism 5.1 12.0 12.24 which is far less extreme. As he expounds it Academic scepticism involves only a denial of dogmatic certainty while allowing for rational discrimination between beliefs that are more or less probable. He also connects this with a second type of mitigated scepticism 12.256 which advocates a limitation of our enquiries to such subjects as are best adapted to the narrow capacity of human understanding. Hume most explicitly identies himself as an Academic sceptic in Part iii of Section XII though he also expresses sympathy with sceptical views at a number of other places e.g. However he clearly dissociates himself from extreme scepticism both of the Pyrrhonian 12.21 12.23 and Cartesian 12.3 varieties dismissing them as unsustainable and selfdefeating. Epicurus and Epicureanism Epicurus 341271 bc was a materialist and atomist accounting for our situation in the universe as due to the everchanging conguration of atoms in the innite void. Man lives and dies as part of this nature with Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers 222 no supernatural obligations and nothing to hope for or fear after death. Morally this recognition of our true situation can give us peace of mind enabling us to live in moderation valuing friendship and avoiding hurt to ourselves and others. Epicurus writings were understandably considered dangerously atheistical and accordingly most of them were destroyed during the early Christian era. Our best source for Epicureanism is the long poem De Rerum Natura On the Nature of Things written by the Roman Lucretius c.9455 bc which fortunately survived in a single manuscript and is briey quoted by Hume at 10.30. In the early modern period Epicurus was considered the archetypal atheist so when Humes sceptical friend in Enquiry Section XI chooses Epicurus as his model 11.2 11.47 11.24 11.27 11.30 the implication is clear. The only mention of Epicureanism elsewhere in the Enquiry is very brief in an apparently approving allusion to its moral principles 12.23. Stoicism Stoicism a movement originating with Zeno of Citium 334262 bc was named after the painted Stoa covered walk in Athens where he taught. Stoicism is mentioned several times in the Enquiry 5.1 8.34 12.23 as are three of the most notable Stoics of the Roman period the freed slave Epictetus c.55135 ad mentioned at 5.1 the orator Marcus Tullius Cicero 10643 bc at 1.4 5.17 n. 10.18 and the wisest of all the Roman emperors Marcus Aurelius ad 12180 at 10.22 11.2. Morally Stoicism has some resemblance to Epicureanism cf. 2.23 emphasiz ing moderation control of the passions and selfdiscipline. Unlike Epicureanism however it bases this on a rational ideal seeing the world as providentially ordered by Gods reason. Hume evinces a clear dislike both of such providentialism cf. .34 and of the Stoic approach to moral ity 5.1 which he sees as being founded on rened rational selshness rather than the generous human passion of sympathy or fellow feeling for others. However Christian Stoicism which became prominent amongst the moderate clergy and others in eighteenthcentury Scotland diered from ancient Stoicism in precisely this respect. Thinkers such as Francis Hutcheson Hugh Blair and William Robertson all well known to Hume sought to reconcile Christian belief with a broadly secu lar ethical outlook. But Hutcheson especially followed Lord Shaftesbury in basing his moral theory on sentiment rather than pure reason signicantly inuencing Hume and in turn Adam Smith 90 an admirer and close friend of Hume now best known as an economist. Descartes Malebranche and Occasionalism Ren Descartes is often called the father of modern philosophy because he was so inuential in the downfall of Aristotelianism. He used sceptical arguments to clear the ground see above but his own philoso phy was rationalistic aiming to build a solid edice of knowledge on pure reason. His famous cogito I think therefore I am is used to establish by example the unique reliability of rational clear and distinct perception and also that the minds essence is thinking. He aims to evade scepticism by proving Gods existence from his own supposedly innate idea of a perfect being together with causal principles which he claims to perceive clearly and distinctly e.g. Having established the existence of a perfectand therefore non deceivingcreator he then concludes that human faculties must be essen tially trustworthy if used appropriately and this vindicates the project of investigating the world scientically relying on our natural senses and innate judgement rather than tradition. Descartes had strong interests in natural philosophy i.e. He also formed the hypothesis of the circulation of the blood in opposition to Galens traditional view independently of William Harvey who published his more famous account in and concluded that the Earth orbits the Sun echoing Copernicus and Galile. For an account of Descartess very inuential physical theory based on the notion that the essence of matter is extension see 2 of the Introduction above. Descartes is explicitly mentioned twice in the Enquiry together with the Cartesian movement named after him 7.25 endnote 12.3. The most prominent Cartesian of the later seventeenth century Nicolas Malebranche is also mentioned twice by name 1.4 7.25 endnote and his occasionalist theory is criticized at length at 7.215. For a brief account of this theory and his arguments for it see 6 of the Introduction. Some of Humes own arguments in Section VII of the Enquiry for the conclusion that causal necessity is unperceivable are reminiscent of Malebranche. Thomas Hobbes Thomas Hobbes the rst great philosopher to write in the English language had a considerablethough unacknowledged inuence on Hume. Still today important as a political philosopher he expressed the ambition to give a genuinely scientic account of man based on theories of the material world the passions and natural law. There are hints of a similar structure in Humes Treatise and very clear Hobbesian echoes in Section VIII of the Enquiry see 4 of the Introduction above where Hume presents a compatibilist position serving a fundamentally similar agenda the legitimation of a deterministic science of man. Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers 223 Though often thought of as empiricist in outlook for example he denies innate principles Hobbes is in many respects rather close to Descartes with considerable emphasis on the role of logical demonstrationas opposed to experimentin science. He also follows Descartes in viewing the physical world as a plenum see 2 of the Introduction. But he conspicu ously diers in his materialism denying the intelligibility of Descartess immaterial mental substance and viewing all mindsboth human and divineas material things. This provoked widespread accusations of atheist and Epicurean with Hobbist becoming a comparable term of abuse in the seventeenth century. Hence Humes reluctance to make ref erence to Hobbess views except when he has something critical to say e.g. Treatise 1.3.3.4 n Moral Enquiry 3.15 n as when summing Hobbes up in the History of England vi. 53 Hobbess politics are tted only to promote tyranny and his ethics to encourage licentiousness. Though an enemy to religion he partakes nothing of the spirit of scepticism but is as positive and dogmatical as if human reason and his reason in particular could attain a thorough conviction in these subjects. Clearness and propriety of style are the chief excellencies of Hobbess writings. Bacon and Gassendi Precursors of Modern Empiricism Francis Bacon was a prominent lawyer and politician under Queen Elizabeth I and James I of England rising to the position of Lord Chancellor. He also wrote on history science and scientic method the latter works being strongly critical of Aristotelianism and its emphasis on logical deduction from rst principles. Bacon instead advocated an induc tive empirical approach based largely on eliminative methods i.e. He is mentioned approvingly by Hume in the introduction to the Treatise described as the father of experimental physicks in the second paragraph of the Abstract and quoted in the Enquiry at 10.39. This last paragraph is of particular interest for its implication that the sceptical attitude which Hume shows towards miracles is not to be conned either to religious contexts or to allegedly unique events but is also to be extended to every thing that is to be found in the writers of natural magic or alchimy and hence presumably what we would now call New Age or allegedly paranormal phenomena. Pierre Gassendi was a French philosopher and scientist best known today for his authorship of a set of Objections to Descartess Meditations but in his time arguably the rst modern empiricist. Inuenced both by Epicurus and scepticism he attacked Aristotle denied innate ideas emphasized sense experience as the source of all ideas and know ledge and displayed a Lockean agnosticism about the essences of things. He also anticipated Humes views about the reason of animals though Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers 224 whether Hume ever read him is doubtful. His most signicant legacy was in reviving Epicurean atomism though with important modications e.g. Whether directly or indirectly this was to inuence Boyle Locke and Newton and thus the development of modern science as explained in 3 of the Introduction above. Locke and the Modern or New Philosophy John Locke widely considered the greatest ever English philosopher Hume of course being Scottish was also arguably the most important single inuence on Hume. Though now most noted as an epis temologist he also wrote major works on the theory of politics property education and religion becoming a standardbearer for liberalism and tolerant moderation. In the early eighteenth century he was possibly the most famous intellectual in the western world and his inuence persisted throughout that century as evident for example in the American Declaration of Independence of which echoes his words and phrasing. Not sur prisingly Locke is mentioned several times in the pages of the Enquiry 1.4 2.9 endnote 6.0 n. For discussion of Lockes epistemological views see 3 and 6 of the Introduction above. His approach has some signicant similarities with that of Descartes notably in mounting a vigorous attack on Aristotelian positions and in adopting a distinction between primary and secondary qualities together with a representative theory of perception. This combi nation of positions was common to most of the modern philosophers of the period contrasting with the ancient Aristotelians. Humes refer ences to the modern philosophy e.g. Treatise 1.4.4 modern enquirers E 12.15 and the new philosophy E 7.25 endnote should be inter preted accordingly though his emphasis on solidity as a primary quality clearly indicates that he has Lockes formulation specically in mind. Lockes epistemology contrasts most sharply with that of Descartes in its relatively rigorous empiricism basing our ideas and understanding of the world on experience and probability rather than the alleged innate certain ties of pure reason. Berkeley and Modern Metaphysicians George Berkeley Anglican bishop of Cloyne in Ireland from is commonly thought of as the second of the three classical British Empiricists lined up with Locke and Hume against the three Continental Rationalists Descartes Spinoza and Leibniz. But this is a crude oversimplication both brought about by and in its turn promot ing the neglect of philosophers and trends that t uneasily into that sim plistic structure. It is true that Berkeleys arguments react mainly to Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers 225 Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers 226 Locke and also that Hume adopts some of these most notably against the primarysecondary quality distinction at E 12.15 endnot. However in overall metaphysical orientation Berkeleys immaterialism has far more in common with the occasionalism of the Cartesian Malebranche see above and 6 of the Introduction. Hume probably has both immaterialists and occasionalists in mind when he talks of modern metaphysicians at 7.25 endnote and perhaps in particular Andrew Baxter a Scottish occasionalist who lived near Hume for some time corresponded with Humes kinsman Henry Home see below and expressed strong views about the inertness of matter and its theological implications. The Scottish CommonSense Philosophers The philosophers in the commonsense tradition produced their main works afterand in reaction toHume. However Kames Reid and Beattie all ourished in Humes lifetime and all are mentioned in the letter extracts included in this volume see Appendix IV above. Henry Home was related to Hume came from nearby in the Scottish Borders and played the role of a mentor when Hume went to study in Edinburgh. In he was appointed as a judge and took the Title Lord Kames. Though bestknown for his aesthetics in which he takes a sentimentalist position his Essays on the Principles of Morality and Natural Religion are of most relevance to the Enquiry. Here Kames argues for an antisceptical providential naturalism in which our natural intu itions and senses have been implanted by God as reliable guides and are therefore to be taken as epistemologically authoritative. Thomas Reid 96 a friend of Kames who shared his providen tial naturalism and consequent respect for commonsense was the most important critic of Hume during his lifetime. An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense published in systematically attacks the theory of ideas so widely taken for granted by early modern philosophers arguing that Humes ridiculously extreme scepticism is its logical result and thereby demonstrates its falsity. Reid directs all his re at Humes Treatise in which the theory of ideas plays a far larger role than in the Enquiry and the scepticism is far more corrosive. James Beattie likewise mainly attacked the Treatise in his abusive Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth of and it is possible that this partly provoked Humes public disavowal of the Treatise through his Advertisement see the letter to Strahan 26 October in Appendix IV. Natural Philosophers i.e. Scientists Nicolaus Copernicus was a Polish astronomer and mathe matician who devised the rst modern formulation of a heliocentric theory of the solar system i.e. His book On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres was published in the year of his death with an introduction presenting the theory more as a means of calculating the apparent motions of the heavens as an aid to devising an accurate calendar than as a claim to astronomical truth. Copernicus was not the rst to put forward a heliocentric theory Aristarchus of Samos c.310230 bc proposed one though this work was lost like most other pagan texts during the early Christian era. Galileo Galilei was an Italian physicist and astronomer whose observations provided the rst decisive evidence for the heliocen tric theory notably the phases of Venus which proved that Venus is some times on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth. Galileo also did important work in dynamics helping to establish the principle of inertia. See 12 of the Introduction for more on all this and 4 on his famous condemnation by the Roman Catholic Inquisition. Hume greatly admired Galileo and mentions him in the extracts from the Dialogues in this volume see Appendix III. Tycho Brahe was a Danish astronomer and nobleman who built an observatory on the island of Hven and made the most accurate astronomical measurements then available. In he observed a super nova in the constellation Cassiopeia indicating that the heavens are not unchanging as Aristotle had taught. However unconvinced that the Earth moves he proposed an alternative theory of the solar system in which the Sun orbits the Earth while the planets orbit the Sun. Johannes Kepler was a German astronomer and mathe matician who became assistant to Brahe and inherited his observations. Using these he established that the planets move not in circles as both Copernicus and Galileo had assumed but in ellipses and he devised three mathematical laws of planetary motionbased on a heliocentric model that provided the rst genuinely accurate method of predicting astronomical phenomena. Robert Boyle 91 was an Irish natural philosopher arguably the rst modern chemist and famous for Boyles Law which relates the pres sure to the volume of an enclosed quantity of gas at constant temperature. His impact on Locke is described in 3 of the Introduction while Humes History of England vi. 41 provides a useful summary there ourished during this period a Boyle and a Newton men who trod with cautious and therefore the more secure steps the only road which leads to true philosophy. Boyle improved the pneumatic engine invented by Otto Guericke and was thereby enabled to make several new and curious experiments on the air as well as on other bodies His chemistry is much admired by those who are acquainted with Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers 227 that art His hydrostatics contain a greater mixture of reasoning and invention with experiment than any other of his works but his reasoning is still remote from that boldness and temerity which had led astray so many philosophers. Boyle was a great partizan of the mechanical philosophy a theory which by discovering some of the secrets of nature and allowing us to imagine the rest is so agreeable to the natural vanity and curiosity of men. He died in aged 65. Isaac Newton perhaps the most celebrated scientist in history was an English mathematician and physicist. He invented the cal culus but delayed Publication provoking a bitter priority battle with the German philosopher Leibniz and used it to give the rst comprehensive account of terrestrial and astronomical motion as explained in 3 of the Introduction above. Humes History of England vi. 42 gives a glowing summary highlighting the signicant irony that Newtons physics while establishing accurate laws describing phenomena at the same time seemed to make nature less intelligible because gravity could not be explained mechanically In Newton this island may boast of having produced the greatest and rarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the species. Cautious in admit ting no principles but such as were founded on experiment but resolute to adopt every such principle however new or unusual From modesty ignorant of his superiority above the rest of mankind and thence less careful to accommodate his reasonings to common apprehensions More anxious to merit than acquire fame He was from these causes long unknown to the world but his reputation at last broke out with a lustre which scarcely any writer during his own lifetime had ever before attained. While Newton seemed to draw othe veil from some of the mys teries of nature he shewed at the same time the imperfections of the mechanical philosophy and thereby restored her ultimate secrets to that obscurity in which they ever did and ever will remain. He died in aged 85. Newton is mentioned in the important endnote to E 7.25 which aims to dissociate him from some of his Newtonian followers who as explained in 6 of the Introductiontended towards occasionalism with a theological agenda. Glossarial Index of Major Philosophers 228 HUMES INDEX This has been produced from the index of the edition consulting also the and editions to resolve ambiguities or to correct manifest errors i.e. References are given to the location in this volume that seems best to match Humes intention in each case specifying rst a paragraph or endnote followed in brackets by a page number. Where Hume himself indicates two successive pages within a single entry this some times results below in two references to the same paragraph or to the same page. His own references of course are to the pages of the two volumes of his Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects and his original index therefore includes many entries for his essays and the other works in that collection as well as those for the rst Enquiry that are listed here. Capitalization and also punctuation where possible generally follows Humes own except in the case of Fact and Jansenists which seem to have been capital ized only because they were the rst entries under F and I respectively. Note that Hume treated I and J together but modern alphabetical ordering is used here. Some entries might seem puzzling. For instance Immortality of the Soul on what founded and Providence particular on what founded can refer only to paragraphs 11.21 or 11.22 neither of which suggests any reason for the beliefs in immortality or providence. But this is no oversight Hume appears to be making a subtle reference to the context of the sentence From their own conceit and imagination surely in 11.21. This illustrates how Humes index can be of interest not only as a pointer to those topics that he viewed as particularly signicant but also for its various hidden messages and ironic glosses an example of the latter being Berkeley Dr. Abstraction what Note 131.

            "Introduction xi human reason in much the same way as Book I of the Treatise but instead of going on to advocate ever more radical forms of scepticism it then takes human reason seriously for what it is and builds on it a persuasive structure that can vindicate disciplined modern science while condemning traditional metaphysics and irrational superstition.",
            "Having identied the common threads that linked the ancient medieval and early modern worlds we shall then be in a position to turn with more appreciation to the pages of the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding one of the very nest works of philosophy and the authoritative statement of David Humes mature epistemology.",
            "Population growth technological innovation notably gunpowder and the dis covery of new lands cultures and religions unknown to the ancients 2 The Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered the destruction of pagan temples including great libraries such as that in Alexandria in 391 the emperor Justinian then suppressed all the remaining pagan schools in 529.",
            "Finally the Reformation starting with Martin Luthers rebellion against the Church of Rome in led to widespread religious wars founded on philosophical dierences one side took Church authority and tradition as the criterion of truth the other appealed instead to the Spirit of God acting within the individual believer.",
            "Around the Earth at the centre of the universe the Moon planets Sun and stars are arranged in a series of concentric crystalline shells forming a heavenly clockwork driven by the steady rotation of the outermost sphere repeating its circuits eternally with perfect accuracy while generating the dance of the plan ets as seen in the sky.",
            "Likewise the four Galilean moons orbiting around Jupiter undermined the idea that all celestial motion must centre on the Earth while the sequence of the phases of Venus in shapes from crescent to almost circularinvisible to the naked eye but very obvious through a telescopegave decisive evidence against the AristotelianPtolemaic model of the planetary orbits.",
            "Moreover when tested critically specic predictions derived from his theories were found to be quite wrong even applied to such everyday things as the ight of a cannon ball a sledge sliding over an icy pond the dripping of water from a gutter or the fall of stones of dierent sizes.",
            "It is only these socalled primary qualities that feature in the physical theory and they are to be distin guished from secondary qualities such as an objects colour taste or smell which represent the eects of the object on the human senses rather than anything genuinely intrinsic to it.",
            "Locke starts with a vigorous attack on the theory of innate ideas targeting both scholastic and Cartesian attempts to deduce truths by pure reason based on such supposed ideas as for example in Descartess argument that the perfection of our innate idea of God implies a perfect cause.",
            "Occasionally Locke seems to go further than these modest principles would allow sug gesting that the mechanical behaviour of the corpuscular world could in principle be predicted without experiment if only we had senses sucient to inspect it in detail I doubt not but if we could discover the Figure Size Texture and Motion of the minute Constituent parts of any two Bodies we should know without Trial several of their Operations one upon another as we do now the Properties of a Square or a Triangle.",
            "Using his newly invented mathematical tool the calculus he proved that such a force acting on bodies in accordance with his second law8 would indeed generate elliptical orbital motion amongst bodies in space and could also explain the parabolic ight and accelerating fall of projectiles near the Earth.",
            "If his equations correctly described the observed behaviour of objects then his theory including its postulated forces should be deemed acceptable whatever the underlying reality might be and speculation about the ultimate cause of gravitational attraction was both unnecessary and inappropriate unless and until further empir ical evidence emerged that might help to throw light on the matter.",
            "However there are also hints in his writings made louder and more explicit in his followers that the very unintelligibility of gravity has religious signicance as an argument for Gods existence since only the con tinuous power of an almighty being could keep the world working in conformity with a law for which there is no conceivable mechanical explanation.",
            "How then could it be right for any judge human or divine to punish a wrongdoer if the act in question was the product of inexorable causal laws and could have been foreseen by God with absolute certainty before the sinner had even been born Many shied away from facing up to this thorny problem Descartes for example is rather vague about whether determinism applies to the immaterial mind.",
            "Opponents of Calvinism found this doctrine morally monstrous whereby most of mankind including Christians of rival sects are doomed to inevitable hellre owing to the sin of Adam while God who could very easily spare all of them from this eternal torture simply by granting them saving faithin fact spares only very few.",
            "Hume himself living in Calvinist Scotland accordingly took care to avoid overt indelity for example suppressing his own potentially incendiary 10 The Roman Catholic Jansenists who make an appearance in Section X of the Enquiry took a similar approach though most Catholic sects put greater emphasis on good works as also contributing to salvation.",
            "Hume him self experienced prejudice of a less dangerous kind being rejected as an applicant for a chair of Philosophy at Edinburgh in on the ground that his Treatise of Human Nature advocated Principles lead ing to downright Atheism le 17 even though the Treatise for rea sons of prudence contained no explicit discussion of religion.",
            "By then such a condemnation might well have made the Church a laughing stock but it was still prudent for Hume to tread carefully where Christianity was con cerned and an explicit denial of its central doctrines would be very likely both to provoke a hostile reaction and also to upset numerous friends.",
            "Nicolas Malebranche the most inuential Cartesian of the late seventeenth century built on Descartess idea that continual recreation by God is necessary to sustain the world from moment to moment drawing the conclusion that no real causal interaction takes place except through the intervention of God.",
            "When we see an apple for exam ple or when we stretch to pick it up it is God who creates our visual perceptions which are of ideas in His mind to correspond with the reality and it is He who moves our arm or strictly recreates it moment by moment in changing positions to correspond with our willed movement.",
            "It seems odd that a line of thought inspired by physical science namely the mechanical philosophys emphasis on the inertness of matter should lead to metaphysical positions such as occasionalism and immaterialism that deny physical objects any causal role what ever in the world that we perceive.",
            "On this account the aim of science is simply to discover laws that generate true predictions about the perceived phenomena and it is irrelevant whether the unperceived entities such as forces to which those laws appeal actually have any real existence as long as they provide useful instruments of prediction.",
            "If immateri alism is correct then such forcesand even the material objects that Locke and others suppose to be the causes of our perceptionsdo not in fact exist and the apparent intricacy of the physical world is due not to the interaction of complex material mechanisms but instead to Gods direct action.",
            "God benevolently ensures that our perceptions occur in the same patterns as they would if they were caused by such Introduction xxviii 15 Berkeley links this with an intense attack on Lockes doctrine of abstraction the process by which we supposedly come to form general ideas.",
            "He then goes on to attack the rational basis for belief in God Sections X and XI and to advocate a mitigated scepticism which does not aspire to certainty limits our scientic ambitions and restricts them to subjects within the scope of our experience Section XII.",
            "The former highlights the necessity and value of careful precise thinking in establishing general truths about man and the moral world thus the abstruse philosophy can help the easy in much the same way as an anatomist can help a painter as well as fostering the innocent pleasure of discovery.",
            "Thus according to Locke anyone who sees the blue sky or feels a pain has in his mind an idea of that colour or of that sensation and Introduction xxxii likewise anyone who merely thinks about the sky or contemplates pain also has in his mind corresponding ideas.",
            "He therefore restricts the scope of idea to refer to thoughts alone coining the new term impression to refer to sensations and feelings and the term perception for the general class of objects of the mind comprising impressions and ideas together so Lockean ideas become Humean perceptions.",
            "The Association of Ideas The present Section III is merely the rst three paragraphs of what was originally a much longer essay which Hume cut down after the edition by the removal of an extended discussion of the role of the asso ciation of ideas in literature see pp.",
            "Demonstrative and Factual Reasoning a little later in Section IV Hume draws a related distinction between types of reasoning though he does not spend long explaining it per haps because it was already very familiar from the work of John Locke All reasonings may be divided into two kinds namely demonstrative reasoning or that concerning relations of ideas and moral reasoning or that concerning matter of fact and existence.",
            "I will nat urally expect the second ball to move but how can I knowor even have any ground for reasonable beliefthat it will do so Hume starts by pointing out that any such belief about the unobserved appears to be based on causation I predict that the second ball will move on the basis of a belief that the collision will cause it to do so.",
            "But to learn anything from experience we must clearly be able to extrapolate beyond it to draw factual or inductive inferences from what we have observed to what we have not as when we infer that hitherto unobserved billiard balls will behave in the same sorts of ways as those we have experi enced and that the operative causal laws will remain consistent.",
            "Here he is not of course retracting anything in his previous argument what he now calls proofs are still based on instinct rather than on rational insight but he is pointing out that it seems unnatural to call a conclusion such as that all men will die merely probable since our entirely uni form experience in its favour is psychologically entirely compelling leaving no room for doubt.",
            "Section VI aims to provide a brief explanation of probability in Humes new narrower sense showing how the mechanism of causal inference discovered in Section V can be extended to account for our tendency to form beliefs of dierent degrees of conviction in propor tion to mixed evidence.",
            "His basis for this is not made entirely explicit but the underlying motive seems to be the legitimation of probabilistic rea soning conferring it with authority and respectability by showing it to be derivative from a principle which plays such an essential and irresistible role in our mental life.",
            "We see one billiard ball striking another see the second one move no doubt hear a sound but what we do not perceive in any way through the senses is the necessity that we assume connects the two events together in that the one event had to be followed by the other.",
            "Perhaps the impression of necessary connexion is not one that we perceive in particular instances of causal interactions whether these be external or internal physical or mental but is instead an impression that arises from repetition when it leads us through the operation of custom to make causal inferences This connexion therefore which we feel in the mind this customary transition of the imagination from one object to its usual attendant is the sentiment or impression from which we form the idea of power or necessary connexion.",
            "The idea of necessary connexion has now been vindicated as a bona de idea but shown to be copied from something internal which Humein line with his Copy Principlecalls an impression but which would perhaps be more accurately described as a reexive awareness of our own inferential behaviour.",
            "They seem to be intended to capture the circumstances under which we come to ascribe causal connexion with the rst denition focusing on the kind of observation that leads someone to believe in such a connexion namely the observation of what appears to that person to be a constant conjunction while the second denition focuses instead on what the student of human Introduction xlv 25 The main contributions to this ongoing debate are most easily accessible in Rupert Read and Kenneth A.",
            "Hume acknow ledges that his denitions fall short of what might be wished for neither of them identies anything about the specic cause in itself that con nects it with its eect for it is only in virtue of the pattern of events the conjunction in other instances or the consequent tendency to draw inferencesthat the causal link can be ascribed.",
            "Though we hanker after a deeper and more substantial conception of causation some notion of the supposed causal glue that binds events together we cannot achieve this nor even any coherent understanding of what it is that we thus seek This does not however undermine the notion of cause rather it shows that the notion is to be ascribed purely on the basis of Humes two denitions cf.",
            "Hobbes had based his compatibilism on a denition of freedom as being able to do what one wills without hindrance and Humes denition of liberty is in the same spirit By liberty then we can only mean a power of acting or not acting according to the determinations of the will that is if we chuse to remain at rest we may if we chuse to move we also may.",
            "This argument however even if accepted does little to resolve the widely felt tension between determinism and moral responsibility if everything that I do was preordained before I was even born then how can I be genuinely responsible It might now seem that the notion of moral responsibil ity has turned out to be incoherent both requiring and yet being incompatible with determinism.",
            "Section X Of Miracles Though mainly concerned with miracles Section X has a far wider signicance because here we see how Humes theory of induction based on custom has a critical edge helping us to weigh up conicting evidence appropriately particularly in the case of evidence from tes timony.",
            "Finally if a miracle is supposed to establish the religion or sect to which it is attributed and since the various religions are incompatible it follows that the evidence for any miracle will be opposed by the evidence in favour of the far greater number of miracles reported in other reli gions.",
            "Section XI Of a Particular Providence and of a Future State Most of the argument of Section XI is put in the mouth of a friend who loves sceptical paradoxes and placed in a classical context to enable Hume to distance himself from his controversial critique of the Design Argument for a Christian God which when he wrote was the most respected weapon in the theists arsenal cf.",
            "As well as this principle of proportionality that we should proportion hypothe sized causes to their observed eects Section XI also reemphasizes the principle of analogy from Section IX that an inductive argu ments strength varies with the degree of similarity between the objects involved so that any inference from human purposes to those Introduction lii 31 In the excerpt from Humes Dialogues see Appendix III Cleanthes expresses this preference very clearly.",
            "He then moves on to scepticism about factual reasoning rst dismissing on practical groundsan excessive popular variant which takes our inconsistent judgements to undermine all inductive reasoning The great subverter of Pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of scepticism is action and employment and the occupations of common life.",
            "Indeed Hume suggests that a sceptical appreciation of the weakness of our faculties combined with a recog nition of the practical inevitability of belief can lead us to a form of undogmatic mitigated scepticism in which our doubts and beliefs are cautiously assessed and corrected by common sense and reection.",
            "Any work that purports to transcend these limits by establishing matters of fact with demonstrative certaintywhat Immanuel Kant would later call synthetic a priori knowledgecan therefore be roundly condemned as Hume expresses in his famous concluding paragraph When we run over libraries persuaded of these principles what havoc must we make If we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics for instance let us ask Does it contain any abstract reasoning containing quantity or number No.",
            "Here again he expresses enthusiasm for the quality of what would become the Note on the Text lix edition of the Essays and Treatises on Several Subjects including the rst Enquiry and the edition of the History of England I am glad to nd that you have been able to set about this New Edition in earnest.",
            "Hume fails to obtain the Chair of Ethics and Pneumatical Philosophy at Edinburgh University his candidature damaged by an anonymous pamphlet accusing him of Universal Scepticism and Principles leading to downright Atheism to which he replies in a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend in Edinburgh.",
            "Chronology lxv This page intentionally left blank AN ENQUIRY CONCERNING HUMAN UNDERSTANDING ADVERTISEMENT M ost of the principles and reasonings contained in this volume were published in a work in three volumes called a Treatise of Human Nature a work which the Author had projected before he left College and which he wrote and published not long after.",
            "Yet several writers who have honoured the Authors Philosophy with answers have taken care to direct all their batteries against that juvenile work which the Author never acknow ledged and have affected to triumph in any advantages which they imagined they had obtained over it a practice very contrary to all rules of candour and fairdealing and a strong instance of those polemical artifices which a bigotted zeal thinks itself authorised to employ.",
            "As virtue of all objects is allowed to be the most valuable this species of philosophers paint her in the most amiable colours borrowing all helps from poetry and eloquence and treating their subject in an easy and obvious manner and such as is best tted to please the imagination and engage the aections.",
            "They select the most striking observations and instances from common life place opposite characters in a proper contrast and alluring us into the paths of virtue by the views of glory and happiness direct our steps in these paths by the soundest precepts and most illustrious examples.",
            "They think it a reproach to all literature that philosophy should not yet have xed beyond controversy the foundation of morals reasoning and criticism and should for ever talk of truth and falsehood vice and virtue beauty and deformity without being able to determine the source of these distinctions.",
            "While they attempt this arduous task they are deterred by no diculties but proceeding from particular instances to general 5 6 principles they still push on their enquiries to principles more gen eral and rest not satised till they arrive at those original principles by which in every science all human curiosity must be bounded.",
            "Though their speculations seem abstract and even unintelligible to common readers they aim at the approbation of the learned and the wise and think themselves suciently compensated for the labour of their whole lives if they can discover some hidden truths which may contribute to the instruction of posterity.",
            "This also must be confessed that the most durable as well as justest fame has been acquired by the easy philosophy and that abstract reasoners seem hitherto to have enjoyed only a momentary reputation from the caprice or ignorance of their own age but have not been able to support their renown with more equitable posterity.",
            "It is easy for a profound philosopher to commit a mistake in his sub tile reasonings and one mistake is the necessary parent of another while he pushes on his consequences and is not deterred from embrac ing any conclusion by its unusual appearance or its contradiction to popular opinion.",
            "But a philosopher who purposes only to represent the common sense of mankind in more beautiful and more engaging colours if by accident he falls into error goes no farther but renew ing his appeal to common sense and the natural sentiments of the mind returns into the right path and secures himself from any dan gerous illusions.",
            "The mere philosopher is a character which is commonly but little acceptable in the world as being supposed to contribute nothing either to the advantage or pleasure of society while he lives remote from communication with mankind and is wrapped up in principles and notions equally remote from their comprehension.",
            "The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes retaining an equal ability and taste for books company and business preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters and in business that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy.",
            "In order to diuse and cultivate so accomplished a character nothing can be more useful than compositions of the easy style and manner which draw not too much from life require no deep Application or retreat to be comprehended and send back the student among mankind full of noble sentiments and wise precepts applicable to every exigence of human life.",
            "Abstruse thought and profound researches I prohibit and Of the Different Species of Philosophy 5 8 9 will severely punish by the pensive melancholy which they introduce by the endless uncertainty in which they involve you and by the cold reception which your pretended discoveries shall meet with when communicated.",
            "Were the generality of mankind contented to prefer the easy philosophy to the abstract and profound without throwing any blame or contempt on the latter it might not be improper perhaps to comply with this general opinion and allow every man to enjoy without oppo sition his own taste and sentiment.",
            "An artist must be better qualied to succeed in this undertaking who besides a delicate taste and a quick apprehension possesses an accurate knowledge of the internal fabric the operations of the understanding the workings of the passions and the various species of sentiment which discriminate vice and virtue.",
            "While the latter employs all the richest colours of his art and gives his gures the most graceful and engaging airs he must still carry his attention to the inward structure of the human body the position of the muscles the fabric of the bones and the use and gure of every part or organ.",
            "Here indeed lies the justest and most plausible objection against a considerable part of metaphysics that they are not properly a science but arise either from the fruitless eorts of human vanity which would penetrate into subjects utterly inacces sible to the understanding or from the craft of popular superstitions which being unable to defend themselves on fair ground raise these intangling brambles to cover and protect their weakness.",
            "But is this a sucient reason why philosophers should desist from such researches and leave superstition still in possession of her retreat Is it not proper to draw an opposite conclusion and perceive the necessity of carrying the war into the most secret recesses of the enemy In vain do we hope that men from frequent disappointment will at last abandon such airy sciences and discover the proper province of human reason.",
            "For besides that many persons nd too sensible an interest in perpetually recalling such topics besides this I say the motive of blind despair can never reasonably have place in the sciences since however unsuccessful former attempts may have proved there is still room to hope that the industry good fortune or improved sagacity of succeeding generations may reach discoveries unknown to former ages.",
            "The only method of freeing learning at once from these abstruse questions is to enquire seriously into the nature of human understanding and shew from an exact analysis of its powers and capacity that it is by no means tted for such remote and abstruse subjects.",
            "Accurate and just reasoning is the only catholic remedy tted for all persons and all dispositions and is alone able to subvert that abstruse philosophy and metaphysical jargon which being mixed up with popular superstition renders it in a manner impenetrable to careless reasoners and gives it the air of science and wisdom.",
            "It is remarkable concerning the operations of the mind that though most intimately present to us yet whenever they become the object of reection they seem Section I 8 12 13 involved in obscurity nor can the eye readily nd those lines and boundaries which discriminate and distinguish them.",
            "It becomes therefore no inconsiderable part of science barely to know the dierent operations of the mind to separate them from each other to class them under their proper heads and to correct all that seeming disorder in which they lie involved when made the object of reection and enquiry.",
            "This task of ordering and distinguishing which has no merit when performed with regard to external bodies the objects of our senses rises in its value when directed towards the operations of the mind in proportion to the diculty and labour which we meet with in performing it.",
            "And if we can go no farther than this mental geography or delineation of the distinct parts and powers of the mind it is at least a satisfaction to go so far and the more obvious this science may appear and it is by no means obvious the more contemptible still must the ignorance of it be esteemed in all pretenders to learning and philosophy.",
            "It cannot be doubted that the mind is endowed with several powers and faculties that these powers are distinct from each other that what is really distinct to the immediate perception may be distin guished by reection and consequently that there is a truth and falsehood in all propositions on this subject and a truth and false hood which lie not beyond the compass of human understanding.",
            "There are many obvious distinctions of this kind such as those between the will and understanding the imagination and passions which fall within the comprehension of every human creature and the ner and more philosophical distinctions are no less real and certain though more dicult to be comprehended.",
            "And shall we esteem it worthy the labour of a philosopher to give us a true system of the planets and adjust the position and order of those remote bodies while we aect to overlook those who with so much success delineate the parts of the mind in which we are so intimately concerned Of the Different Species of Philosophy 9 14 But may we not hope that philosophy if cultivated with care and encouraged by the attention of the public may carry its researches still farther and discover at least in some degree the secret springs and principles by which the human mind is actuated in its operations Astronomers had long contented themselves with proving from the phaenomena the true motions order and magni tude of the heavenly bodies Till a philosopher at last arose who seems from the happiest reasoning to have also determined the laws and forces by which the revolutions of the planets are governed and directed.",
            "It is probable that one operation and principle of the mind depends on another which again may be resolved into one more general and universal And how far these researches may possibly be carried it will be dicult for us before or even after a careful trial exactly to determine.",
            "This is certain that attempts of this kind are every day made even by those who philoso phize the most negligently And nothing can be more requisite than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough care and attention that if it lie within the compass of human understanding it may at last be happily atchieved if not it may however be rejected with some condence and security.",
            "For how much must we dimin ish from the beauty and value of this species of philosophy upon such a supposition Moralists have hitherto been accustomed when they considered the vast multitude and diversity of those actions that excite our approbation or dislike to Search for some common principle on which this variety of sentiments might depend.",
            "And though they have sometimes carried the matter too far by their passion for some one general principle it must however be confessed that they are excus able in expecting to nd some general principles into which all the vices and virtues were justly to be resolved.",
            "But as after all the abstractedness of these speculations is no recommendation but rather a disadvantage to them and as this di culty may perhaps be surmounted by care and art and the avoiding of all unnecessary detail we have in the following enquiry attempted to throw some light upon subjects from which uncertainty has hith erto deterred the wise and obscurity the ignorant.",
            "Happy if we can unite the boundaries of the dierent species of philosophy by recon ciling profound enquiry with clearness and truth with novelty And still more happy if reasoning in this easy manner we can undermine the foundations of an abstruse philosophy which seems to have hith erto served only as a shelter to superstition and a cover to absurdity and error Of the Different Species of Philosophy 11 16 SECTION II Of the Origin of Ideas E very one will readily allow that there is a considerable dierence between the perceptions of the mind when a man feels the pain of excessive heat or the pleasure of moderate warmth and when he afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation or anticipates it by his imagination.",
            "The utmost we say of them even when they operate with greatest vigour is that they represent their object in so lively a manner that we could almost say we feel or see it But except the mind be disordered by disease or madness they never can arrive at such a pitch of vivacity as to render these perceptions altogether undistinguishable.",
            "And while the body is conned to one planet along which it creeps with pain and diculty the thought can in an instant transport us into the most distant regions of the universe or even beyond the universe into the unbounded chaos where nature is supposed to lie in total confusion.",
            "But though our thought seems to possess this unbounded liberty we shall nd upon a nearer examination that it is really conned within very narrow limits and that all this creative power of the mind amounts to no more than the faculty of compounding transposing augmenting or diminishing the materials aorded us by the senses and experience.",
            "And though there are few or no instances of a like deciency in the mind where a person has never felt or is wholly incapable of a sentiment or passion that belongs to his species yet we nd the same observation to take place in a less degree.",
            "It is readily allowed that other beings may possess many senses of which we can have no conception because the ideas of them have never been intro duced to us in the only manner by which an idea can have access to the mind to wit by the actual feeling and sensation.",
            "For if this should be denied it is possible by the continual gradation of shades to run a colour insensibly into what is most remote Section II 14 20 21 from it and if you will not allow any of the means to be dierent you cannot without absurdity deny the extremes to be the same.",
            "Let all the dierent shades of that colour except that single one be placed before him descending gradually from the deepest to the lightest it is plain that he will perceive a blank where that shade is wanting and will be sensible that there is a greater distance in that place between the contiguous colours than in any other.",
            "Now I ask whether it be possible for him from his own imagination to supply this deciency and raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade though it had never been conveyed to him by his senses I believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can And this may serve as a proof that the simple ideas are not always in every instance derived from the correspondent impres sions though this instance is so singular that it is scarcely worth our observing and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim.",
            "Here therefore is a proposition which not only seems in itself simple and intelligible but if a proper use were made of it might render every dispute equally intelligible and banish all that jargon which has so long taken possession of metaphysical reason ings and drawn disgrace upon them.",
            "All ideas especially abstract ones are naturally faint and obscure The mind has but a slender hold of them They are apt to be confounded with other resembling ideas and when we have often employed any term though without a distinct meaning we are apt to imagine it has a determinate idea annexed to it.",
            "When we entertain therefore any suspicion that a philosophical term is employed without any mean ing or idea as is but too frequent we need but enquire from what impression is that supposed idea derived And if it be impossible to assign any this will serve to conrm our suspicion.",
            "SECTION III Of the Association of Ideas I t is evident that there is a principle of connexion between the dierent thoughts or ideas of the mind and that in their appear ance to the memory or imagination they introduce each other with a certain degree of method and regularity.",
            "Among dierent languages even where we cannot suspect the least connexion or communication it is found that the words expressive of ideas the most compounded do yet nearly correspond to each other a certain proof that the simple ideas comprehended in the compound ones were bound together by some universal principle which had an equal inuence on all mankind.",
            "This part of philosophy it is observable has been little cultivated either by the ancients or moderns and therefore our doubts and errors in the prosecution of so important an enquiry may be the more excusable while we march through such dicult 25 26 paths without any guide or direction.",
            "If you were to ask a man why he believes any matter of fact which is absent for instance that his friend is in the country or in France he would give you a reason and this reason would be some other fact as a letter received from him or the knowledge of his former resolutions and promises.",
            "I shall venture to arm as a general proposition which admits of no exception that the knowledge of this relation is not in any instance attained by reasonings priori but arises entirely from experience when we nd that any particular objects are constantly conjoined with each other.",
            "Let an object be presented to a man of ever so strong natural reason and abilities if that object be entirely new to him he will not be able by the most accurate examination of its sen sible qualities to discover any of its causes or eects.",
            "Adam though Sceptical Doubts 19 27 his rational faculties be supposed at the very rst entirely perfect could not have inferred from the uidity and transparency of water that it would suocate him or from the light and warmth of re that it would consume him.",
            "This proposition that causes and eects are discoverable not by reason but by experience will readily be admitted with regard to such objects as we remember to have once been altogether unknown to us since we must be conscious of the utter inability which we then lay under of foretelling what would arise from them.",
            "Present two smooth pieces of marble to a man who has no tincture of natural philosophy he will never discover that they will adhere together in such a manner as to require great force to separate them in a direct line while they make so small a resistance to a lateral pressure.",
            "Who will assert that he can give the ultimate reason why milk or bread is proper nourishment for a man not for a lion or a tyger But the same truth may not appear at rst sight to have the same evidence with regard to events which have become familiar to us from our rst appearance in the world which bear a close analogy to the whole course of nature and which are supposed to depend on the simple qualities of objects without any secret structure of parts.",
            "We fancy that were we brought on a sudden into this world we could at rst have inferred that one Billiardball would communicate motion to another upon impulse and that we needed not to have waited for the event in order to pronounce with certainty concerning it.",
            "Were any object presented to us and were we required to pronounce concerning the eect which will result from it without consulting past observation after what manner I beseech you must the mind proceed in this operation It must invent or imagine some event which it ascribes to the object as its eect and it is plain that this invention must be entirely arbitrary.",
            "A stone or piece of metal raised into the air and left without any support immediately falls But to consider the matter priori is there any thing we discover in this situation which can beget the idea of a downward rather than an upward or any other motion in the stone or metal And as the rst imagination or invention of a particular eect in all natural operations is arbitrary where we consult not experience so must we also esteem the supposed tye or connexion between the cause and eect which binds them together and renders it impossi ble that any other eect could result from the operation of that cause.",
            "When I see for instance a Billiardball moving in a straight line towards another even suppose motion in the second ball should by accident be suggested to me as the result of their contact or impulse may I not conceive that a hundred dierent events might as well follow from that cause May not both these balls remain at absolute rest May not the rst ball return in a straight line or leap ofrom the second in any line or direction All these suppositions are consis tent and conceivable.",
            "It is confessed that the utmost eort of human reason is to reduce the principles produc tive of natural phaenomena to a greater simplicity and to resolve the many particular eects into a few general causes by means of reason ings from analogy experience and observation.",
            "Elasticity gravity cohesion of parts communication of motion by impulse these are probably the ultimate causes and principles which we shall ever discover in nature and we may esteem ourselves suciently happy if by accurate enquiry and reasoning we can trace up the particular phaenomena to or near to these general principles.",
            "Every part of mixed mathematics proceeds upon the supposition that certain laws are established by nature in her operations and abstract reasonings are employed either to assist ex perience in the discovery of these laws or to determine their inuence in particular instances where it depends upon any precise degree of distance and quantity.",
            "Thus it is a law of motion discovered by ex perience that the moment or force of any body in motion is in the compound ratio or proportion of its solid contents and its velocity and consequently that a small force may remove the greatest obstacle or raise the greatest weight if by any contrivance or machinery we can encrease the velocity of that force so as to make it an overmatch for Section IV 22 31 its antagonist.",
            "Geometry assists us in the Application of this law by giving us the just dimensions of all the parts and gures which can enter into any species of machine but still the discovery of the law itself is owing merely to experience and all the abstract reasonings in the world could never lead us one step towards the knowledge of it.",
            "When we reason priori and consider merely any object or cause as it appears to the mind independent of all observation it never could suggest to us the notion of any distinct object such as its eect much less shew us the inseparable and inviolable connection between them.",
            "Sceptical Doubts 23 32 It must certainly be allowed that nature has kept us at a great distance from all her secrets and has aorded us only the knowledge of a few supercial qualities of objects while she conceals from us those powers and principles on which the inuence of these objects entirely depends.",
            "Sight or feeling conveys an idea of the actual motion of bodies but as to that wonderful force or power which would carry on a moving body for ever in a continued change of place and which bodies never lose but by communicating it to others of this we cannot form the most distant conception.",
            "It is allowed on all hands that there is no known connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret powers and consequently that the mind is not led to form such a conclusion concerning their constant and regular conjunction by any thing which it knows of their nature.",
            "As to past Experience it can be allowed to give direct and certain infor mation of those precise objects only and that precise period of time which fell under its cognizance But why this experience should be extended to future times and to other objects which for aught we know may be only in appearance similar this is the main question on which I would insist.",
            "The bread which I formerly eat nourished me that is a body of such sensible qualities was at that time endued with such secret powers But does it follow that other bread must also nourish me at another time and that like sensible qualities must always be attended with like secret powers The consequence seems nowise necessary.",
            "This negative argument must certainly in process of time become altogether convincing if many penetrating and able philoso phers shall turn their enquiries this way and no one be ever able to discover any connecting proposition or intermediate step which sup ports the understanding in this conclusion.",

            "Sceptical Doubts 25 35 If we be therefore engaged by arguments to put trust in past experience and make it the standard of our future judgment these arguments must be probable only or such as regard matter of fact and real existence according to the division above mentioned.",

            "And though none but a fool or madman will ever pretend to dispute the authority of experience or to reject that great guide of human life it may surely be allowed a philosopher to have so much curiosity at least as to examine the principle of human nature which gives this mighty authority to experience and makes us draw advantage from that similarity which nature has placed among dierent objects.",
            "Now where is that process of reasoning which from one instance draws a conclusion so dierent from that which it infers from a hundred instances that are nowise dierent from that single one This question I propose as much for the sake of information as with an intention of raising diculties.",
            "The question still recurs on what process of argument this inference is founded Where is the medium the interposing ideas which join propositions so very wide of each other It is confessed that the colour consistence and other sensible qualities of bread appear not of themselves to have any connexion with the secret powers of nour ishment and support.",
            "When a man says I have found in all past instances such sensible qualities conjoined with such secret powers And when he says similar sensible qualities will always be conjoined with similar secret powers he is not guilty of a tautol ogy nor are these propositions in any respect the same.",

            "If you hesitate therefore a moment or if after reection you produce any intricate or profound argument you in a manner give up the question and confess that it is not reasoning which engages us to suppose the past resembling the future and to expect similar eects from causes which are to appearance similar.",

            "It is certain that while we aspire to the magnanimous rmness of the philosophic sage and endeavour to conne our pleasures altogether within our own minds we may at last render our philosophy like that of Epictetus and other Stoics only a more rened system of selshness and reason ourselves out of all virtue as well as social enjoyment.",
            "While we study with attention the vanity of human life and turn all our thoughts towards the empty and transitory nature of riches and honours we are perhaps all the while attering our natural indolence which hating the bustle of the world and drudg ery of business seeks a pretence of reason to give itself a full and uncontrouled indulgence.",
            "There is however one species of philoso phy which seems little liable to this inconvenience and that because it strikes in with no disorderly passion of the human mind nor can mingle itself with any natural aection or propensity and that is the Academic or Sceptical philosophy.",
            "Though we should conclude for instance as in the foregoing section that in all reasonings from experience there is a step taken by the mind which is not supported by any argument or process of the understanding there is no danger that these reasonings on which almost all knowledge depends will ever be aected by such a discovery.",
            "Suppose a person though endowed with the strongest faculties of reason and reection to be brought on a sudden into this world he would indeed immediately observe a continual succession of objects and one event following another but he would not be able to discover any thing farther.",
            "He would not at rst by any reasoning be able to reach the idea of cause and eect since the particular powers by which all natural operations are performed never appear to the senses nor is it reasonable to conclude merely because one event in one instance precedes another that therefore the one is the cause the other the eect.",
            "Suppose again that he has acquired more experience and has lived so long in the world as to have observed similar objects or events to be constantly conjoined together what is the consequence of this experience He immediately infers the existence of one object from the appearance of the other.",
            "Yet he has not by all his experience Sceptical Solution of these Doubts 31 42 acquired any idea or knowledge of the secret power by which the one object produces the other nor is it by any process of reasoning he is engaged to draw this inference.",
            "And it is certain we here advance a very intelligible proposition at least if not a true one when we assert that after the constant conjunction of two objects heat and ame for instance weight and solidity we are determined by custom alone to expect the one from the appearance of the other.",
            "But here it may be proper to remark that though our conclu sions from experience carry us beyond our memory and senses and assure us of matters of fact which happened in the most distant places and most remote ages yet some fact must always be present to the senses or memory from which we may rst proceed in drawing these conclusions.",
            "In a word if we proceed not upon some fact present to the memory or senses our reasonings would be merely hypothetical and however the particular links might be connected with each other the whole chain of inferences would have nothing to support it nor could we ever by its means arrive at the knowledge of any real exis tence.",
            "Or in other words having found in many instances that any two kinds of objects ame and heat snow and cold have always been conjoined together if ame or snow be presented anew to the senses the mind is carried by custom to expect heat or cold and to believe that such a quality does exist and will discover itself upon a nearer approach.",
            "PART II Nothing is more free than the imagination of man and though it cannot exceed that original stock of ideas furnished by the internal and external senses it has unlimited power of mixing compounding separating and dividing these ideas in all the varieties of ction and vision.",

            "Whenever any object is presented to the memory or senses it immediately by the force of custom carries the imagination to conceive that object which is usu ally conjoined to it and this conception is attended with a feeling or sentiment dierent from the loose reveries of the fancy.",
            "For as there is no matter of fact which we believe so rmly that we cannot conceive the contrary there would be no dierence between the conception assented to and that which is rejected were it not for some sentiment which distinguishes the one from the other.",
            "Were we to attempt a denition of this sentiment we should perhaps nd it a very dicult if not an impossible task in the same manner as if we should endeavour to dene the feeling of cold or pas sion of anger to a creature who never had any experience of these sentiments.",
            "This variety of terms which may seem so unphilosophical is intended only to express that act of the mind which renders realities or what is taken for such more present to us than ctions causes them to weigh more in the thought and gives them a superior inuence on the passions and imagination.",
            "Let us then take in the whole compass of this doctrine and allow that the sentiment of belief is nothing but a conception more intense and steady than what attends the mere ctions of the imagi nation and that this manner of conception arises from a customary conjunction of the object with something present to the memory or senses I believe that it will not be dicult upon these suppositions to nd other operations of the mind analogous to it and to trace up these phaenomena to principles still more general.",
            "These principles of connexion or association we have reduced to three namely Resemblance Contiguity and Causation which are the only bonds that unite our thoughts together and beget that regular train Section V 36 50 of reection or discourse which in a greater or less degree takes place among all mankind.",
            "Does it happen in all these relations that when one of the objects is presented to the senses or memory the mind is not only carried to the conception of the correlative but reaches a steadier and stronger conception of it than what otherwise it would have been able to attain This seems to be the case with that belief which arises from the relation of cause and eect.",
            "We may therefore observe as the rst experiment to our present purpose that upon the appearance of the picture of an absent friend our idea of him is evidently enlivened by the resem blance and that every passion which that idea occasions whether of joy or sorrow acquires new force and vigour.",
            "Where the picture bears him no resemblance at least was not intended for him it never so much as conveys our thought to him And where it is absent as well as the person though the mind may pass from the thought of the one to that of the other it feels its idea to be rather weakened than enlivened by that transition.",
            "The devotees of that superstition usually plead in excuse for the mummeries with which they are upbraided that they feel the good eect of those external motions and postures and actions in enlivening their devotion and quickening their fervour which otherwise would decay if directed entirely to distant and immaterial objects.",
            "I shall only infer from these practices and this reasoning that the eect of resemblance Sceptical Solution of these Doubts 37 51 52 in enlivening the ideas is very common and as in every case a resem blance and a present impression must concur we are abundantly sup plied with experiments to prove the reality of the foregoing principle.",

            "Superstitious people are fond of the reliques of saints and holy men for the same reason that they seek after types or images in order to enliven their devotion and give them a more intimate and strong conception of those exemplary lives which they desire to imitate.",
            "Now it is evi dent that one of the best reliques which a devotee could procure would be the handywork of a saint and if his cloaths and furniture are ever to be considered in this light it is because they were once at his disposal and were moved and aected by him in which respect they are to be considered as imperfect eects and as connected with Section V 38 53 9 Naturane nobis inquit datum dicam an errore quodam ut cum ea loca videamus in quibus memoria dignos viros acceperimus multum esse versatos magis moveamur quam siquando eorum ipsorum aut facta audiamus aut scriptum aliquod legamus Velut ego nunc moveor.",
            "Suppose that the son of a friend who had been long dead or absent were presented to us it is evident that this object would instantly revive its correlative idea and recal to our thoughts all past intimacies and familiarities in more lively colours than they would otherwise have appeared to us.",
            "When a sword is levelled at my breast does not the idea of wound and pain strike me more strongly than when a glass of wine is presented to me even though by accident this idea should occur after the appearance of the latter object But what is there in this whole matter to cause such a strong conception except only a present object and a customary transition to the idea of another object which we have been accustomed to conjoin with the former This is the whole operation of the mind in all our conclu sions concerning matter of fact and existence and it is a satisfaction to nd some analogies by which it may be explained.",
            "Here then is a kind of preestablished harmony between the course of nature and the succession of our ideas and though the powers Sceptical Solution of these Doubts 39 54 and forces by which the former is governed be wholly unknown to us yet our thoughts and conceptions have still we nd gone on in the same train with the other works of nature.",
            "Had not the presence of an object instantly excited the idea of those objects commonly conjoined with it all our knowledge must have been limited to the narrow sphere of our memory and senses and we should never have been able to adjust means to ends or employ our natural powers either to the producing of good or avoiding of evil.",
            "I shall add for a further conrmation of the foregoing theory that as this operation of the mind by which we infer like eects from like causes and vice versa is so essential to the subsistence of all human creatures it is not probable that it could be trusted to the fallacious deductions of our reason which is slow in its operations appears not in any degree during the rst years of infancy and at best is in every age and period of human life extremely liable to error and mistake.",
            "It is more conformable to the ordinary wisdom of nature to secure so necessary an act of the mind by some instinct or mechanical tendency which may be infallible in its operations may discover itself at the rst appearance of life and thought and may be independent of all the laboured deductions of the understanding.",
            "As nature has taught us the use of our limbs without giving us the knowledge of the muscles and nerves by which they are actuated so has she implanted in us an instinct which carries forward the thought in a correspondent course to that which she has established among external objects though we are ignorant of those powers and forces on which this regular course and succession of objects totally depends.",
            "There is certainly a probability which arises from a superiority of chances on any side and according as this superiority encreases and surpasses the opposite chances the probability receives a proportion able encrease and begets still a higher degree of belief or assent to that side in which we discover the superiority.",
            "If a dye were marked with one gure or number of spots on four sides and with another gure or number of spots on the two remaining sides it would be more prob able that the former would turn up than the latter though if it had a thousand sides marked in the same manner and only one side dierent the probability would be much higher and our belief or expectation of the event more steady and secure.",
            "It seems evident that when the mind looks forward to dis cover the event which may result from the throw of such a dye it considers the turning up of each particular side as alike probable and this is the very nature of chance to render all the particular events comprehended in it entirely equal.",
            "This concurrence of several views in one particular event begets immediately by an inexplicable contrivance of nature the sentiment of belief and gives that event the advantage over its antagonist which is supported by a smaller number of views and recurs less frequently 56 57 10 Mr.",
            "The concurrence of these several views or glimpses imprints the idea more strongly on the imagination gives it superior force and vigour renders its inuence on the passions and aections more sen sible and in a word begets that reliance or security which constitutes the nature of belief and opinion.",
            "But where dierent eects have been found to follow from causes which are to appear ance exactly similar all these various eects must occur to the mind in transferring the past to the future and enter into our considera tion when we determine the probability of the event.",
            "Though we give the preference to that which has been found most usual and believe that this eect will exist we must not overlook the other eects but must assign to each of them a particular weight and author ity in proportion as we have found it to be more or less frequent.",
            "It is more probable in almost every country of Europe that there will be frost sometime in January than that the weather will continue open throughout that whole month though this probability varies according to the dierent climates and approaches to a certainty in the more northern kingdoms.",
            "Here then it seems evident that when Section VI 42 58 we transfer the past to the future in order to determine the eect which will result from any cause we transfer all the dierent events in the same proportion as they have appeared in the past and conceive one to have existed a hundred times for instance another ten times and another once.",
            "As a great number of views do here concur in one event they fortify and conrm it to the imagination beget that sentiment which we call belief and give its object the preference above the contrary event which is not supported by an equal number of experiments and recurs not so frequently to the thought in trans ferring the past to the future.",
            "Of Probability 43 59 SECTION VII Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion PART I T he great advantage of the mathematical sciences above the moral consists in this that the ideas of the former being sensible are always clear and determinate the smallest distinction between them is immediately perceptible and the same terms are still expressive of the same ideas without ambiguity or variation.",
            "If any term be dened in geometry the mind readily of itself substitutes on all occasions the denition for the term dened Or even when no denition is employed the object itself may be presented to the senses and by that means be steadily and clearly apprehended.",

            "And if moral ideas are apt without extreme care to fall into obscurity and con fusion the inferences are always much shorter in these disquisitions and the intermediate steps which lead to the conclusion much fewer than in the sciences which treat of quantity and number.",
            "As moral philosophy seems hitherto to have received less improvement than either geometry or physics we may conclude that if there be any dierence in this respect among these sciences the diculties which obstruct the progress of the former require superior care and capacity to be surmounted.",
            "It seems a proposition which will not admit of much dispute that all our ideas are nothing but copies of our impressions or in other words that it is impossible for us to think of any thing which we have not antecedently felt either by our external or internal senses.",
            "And by this means we may perhaps attain a new microscope or species of optics by which in the moral sciences the most minute and most simple ideas may be so enlarged as to fall readily under our apprehension and be equally known with the grossest and most sensible ideas that can be the object of our enquiry.",
            "When we look about us towards external objects and consider the operation of causes we are never able in a single instance to dis cover any power or necessary connexion any quality which binds the eect to the cause and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other.",
            "In reality there is no part of matter that does ever by its sen sible qualities discover any power or energy or give us ground to imagine that it could produce any thing or be followed by any other object which we could denominate its eect.",
            "The scenes of the universe are continually shifting and one object follows another in an uninterrupted succession but the power or force which actuates Section VII 46 63 the whole machine is entirely concealed from us and never discovers itself in any of the sensible qualities of body.",
            "Since therefore external objects as they appear to the senses give us no idea of power or necessary connexion by their operation in particular instances let us see whether this idea be derived from reection on the operations of our own minds and be copied from any internal impression.",
            "This inuence we may observe is a fact which like all other natural events can be known only by experience and can never be foreseen from any apparent energy or power in the cause which connects it with the eect and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other.",
            "For rst is there any principle in all nature more mysterious than the union of soul with body by which a supposed spiritual substance acquires such an inuence over a material one that the most rened thought is able to actuate the grossest matter Were we empow ered by a secret wish to remove mountains or control the planets in their orbit this extensive authority would not be more extraordinary nor more beyond our comprehension.",
            "But if by consciousness we perceived any power or energy in the will we must know this power we must know its connexion with the eect we must know the secret union of soul and body and the nature of both these substances by which the one is able to operate in so many instances upon the other.",
            "Thirdly We learn from anatomy that the immediate object of power in voluntary motion is not the member itself which is moved but certain muscles and nerves and animal spirits and perhaps something still more minute and more unknown through which the motion is successively propagated ere it reach the member itself whose motion is the immediate object of volition.",
            "Can there be Section VII 48 66 a more certain proof that the power by which this whole operation is performed so far from being directly and fully known by an inward sentiment or consciousness is to the last degree mysterious and unintelligible Here the mind wills a certain event Immediately another event unknown to ourselves and totally dierent from the one intended is produced This event produces another equally unknown Till at last through a long succession the desired event is produced.",
            "How indeed can we be conscious of a power to move our limbs when we have no such power but only that to move certain animal spirits which though they produce at last the motion of our limbs yet operate in such a manner as is wholly beyond our comprehension We may therefore conclude from the whole I hope without any temerity though with assurance that our idea of power is not copied from any sentiment or consciousness of power within ourselves when we give rise to animal motion or apply our limbs to their proper use and oce.",
            "Shall we then assert that we are conscious of a power or energy in our own minds when by an act or command of our will we raise up a new idea x the mind to the contemplation of it turn it on all sides and at last dismiss it for some other idea when we think that we have surveyed it with sucient accuracy I believe the same arguments will prove that even this command of the will gives us no real idea of force or energy.",
            "But do we pretend to be acquainted with the nature of the human soul and the nature of an idea or the aptitude of the one to produce the other This is a real creation a production of Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion 49 67 68 13 See endnote p.",
            "Secondly The command of the mind over itself is limited as well as its command over the body and these limits are not known by reason or any acquaintance with the nature of cause and eect but only by experience and observation as in all other natural events and in the operation of external objects.",
            "Can we give any reason for these variations except experience Where then is the power of which we pretend to be conscious Is there not here either in a spiritual or material substance or both some secret mechanism or structure of parts upon which the eect depends and which being entirely unknown to us renders the power or energy of the will equally unknown and incomprehensible Volition is surely an act of the mind with which we are suciently acquainted.",
            "Do you nd any thing in it like this creative power by which it raises from nothing a new idea and with a kind of Fiat imitates the omnipotence of its Maker if I may be allowed so to speak who called forth into existence all the various scenes of nature So far from being conscious of this energy in the will it requires as certain expe rience as that of which we are possessed to convince us that such extraordinary eects do ever result from a simple act of volition.",
            "The generality of mankind never nd any diculty in account ing for the more common and familiar operations of nature such as the descent of heavy bodies the growth of plants the generation of animals or the nourishment of bodies by food But suppose that in Section VII 50 69 all these cases they perceive the very force or energy of the cause by which it is connected with its eect and is for ever infallible in its oper ation.",
            "But philosophers who carry their scrutiny a little farther immediately perceive that even in the most familiar events the energy of the cause is as unintelligible as in the most unusual and that we only learn by experience the frequent Conjunction of objects without being ever able to comprehend any thing like Connexion between them.",
            "They pretend that those objects which are commonly denominated causes are in reality nothing but occasions and that the true and direct principle of every eect is not any power or force in nature but a volition of the Supreme Being who wills that such particular objects should for ever be conjoined with each other.",
            "Instead of saying that one billiardball moves another by a force which it has derived from the author of nature it is the Deity himself they say who by a particular volition moves the second ball being determined to this operation by the impulse of the rst ball in consequence of those general laws which he has laid down to himself in the government of the universe.",
            "But philosophers advanc ing still in their enquiries discover that as we are totally ignorant of the power on which depends the mutual operation of bodies we are no less ignorant of that power on which depends the operation of Of the Idea of Necessary Connexion 51 70 14 .",
            "They assert that the Deity is the immediate cause of the union between soul and body and that they are not the organs of sense which being agitated by external objects produce sensations in the mind but that it is a particular volition of our omnipotent Maker which excites such a sensation in consequence of such a motion in the organ.",
            "In like manner it is not any energy in the will that produces local motion in our members It is God himself who is pleased to second our will in itself impotent and to command that motion which we erroneously attribute to our own power and ecacy.",
            "It argues more wisdom to contrive at rst the fabric of the world with such perfect foresight that of itself and by its proper operation it may serve all the pur poses of providence than if the great Creator were obliged every moment to adjust its parts and animate by his breath all the wheels of that stupendous machine.",
            "First It seems to me that this theory of the universal energy and operation of the Supreme Being is too bold ever to carry convic tion with it to a man suciently apprized of the weakness of human Section VII 52 71 72 reason and the narrow limits to which it is conned in all its opera tions.",
            "Though the chain of arguments which conduct to it were ever so logical there must arise a strong suspicion if not an absolute assurance that it has carried us quite beyond the reach of our faculties when it leads to conclusions so extraordinary and so remote from common life and experience.",
            "And however we may atter ourselves that we are guided in every step which we take by a kind of verisimili tude and experience we may be assured that this fancied experience has no authority when we thus apply it to subjects that lie entirely out of the sphere of experience.",
            "We are ignorant it is true of the manner in which bodies operate on each other Their force or energy is entirely incomprehensible But are we not equally ignorant of the manner or force by which a mind even the supreme mind operates either on itself or on body Whence I beseech you do we acquire any idea of it We have no sentiment or consciousness of this power in ourselves.",

            "And as we can have no idea of any thing which never appeared to our outward sense or inward sentiment the necessary conclusion seems to be that we have no idea of connexion or power at all and that these words are absolutely without any meaning when employed either in philosophical reasonings or common life.",

            "Even after one instance or experiment where we have observed a particular event to follow upon another we are not entitled to form a general rule or fore tel what will happen in like cases it being justly esteemed an unpardon able temerity to judge of the whole course of nature from one single experiment however accurate or certain.",
            "But when one particular species of event has always in all instances been conjoined with another we make no longer any scruple of foretelling one upon the appearance of the other and of employing that reasoning which can alone assure us of any matter of fact or existence.",
            "It appears then that this idea of a necessary connexion among events arises from a number of similar instances which occur Section VII 54 74 75 of the constant conjunction of these events nor can that idea ever be suggested by any one of these instances surveyed in all possible lights and positions.",
            "But there is nothing in a number of instances dierent from every single instance which is supposed to be exactly similar except only that after a repetition of similar instances the mind is carried by habit upon the appearance of one event to expect its usual attendant and to believe that it will exist.",
            "When we say therefore that one object is connected with another we mean only that they have acquired a connexion in our thought and give rise to this inference by which they become proofs of each others existence a conclusion which is somewhat extraordinary but which seems founded on sucient evidence.",

            "The rst instance which we saw of motion communicated by the shock of two billiardballs to return to this obvious illustration is exactly similar to any instance that may at present occur to us except only that we could not at rst infer one event from the other which we are enabled to do at present after so long a course of uniform experience.",

            "For as the faculties of the mind are supposed to be naturally alike in every individual otherwise nothing could be more fruitless than to reason or dispute together it were impossible if men ax the same ideas to their terms that they could so long form dierent opinions of the same subject especially when they communicate their views and each party turn themselves on all sides in Search of arguments which may give them the victory over their antagonists.",
            "It is true if men attempt the discussion of questions which lie entirely beyond the reach of human capacity such as those concerning the origin of worlds or the oeconomy of the intellectual system or region of spirits they may long beat the air in their fruitless contests and never arrive at any determinate conclusion.",
            "This has been the case in the long disputed question concerning liberty and necessity and to so remarkable a degree that if I be not 80 81 much mistaken we shall nd that all mankind both learned and ignorant have always been of the same opinion with regard to this subject and that a few intelligible denitions would immediately have put an end to the whole controversy.",
            "I own that this dispute has been so much canvassed on all hands and has led philosophers into such a labyrinth of obscure sophistry that it is no wonder if a sens ible reader indulge his ease so far as to turn a deaf ear to the proposal of such a question from which he can expect neither instruction nor entertainment.",
            "It is universally allowed that matter in all its operations is actuated by a necessary force and that every natural eect is so pre cisely determined by the energy of its cause that no other eect in such particular circumstances could possibly have resulted from it.",
            "The degree and direction of every motion is by the laws of nature prescribed with such exactness that a living creature may as soon arise from the shock of two bodies as motion in any other degree or direction than what is actually produced by it.",
            "It seems evident that if all the scenes of nature were continually shifted in such a manner that no two events bore any resemblance to each other but every object was entirely new without any similitude to whatever had been seen before we should never in that case have attained the least idea of necessity or of a connexion among these objects.",
            "Our idea therefore of necessity and Of Liberty and Necessity 59 82 causation arises entirely from the uniformity observable in the oper ations of nature where similar objects are constantly conjoined together and the mind is determined by custom to infer the one from the appearance of the other.",
            "If it appear therefore that all mankind have ever allowed without any doubt or hesitation that these two circumstances take place in the voluntary actions of men and in the operations of mind it must follow that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of necessity and that they have hitherto disputed merely for not understanding each other.",
            "Would you know the sentiments inclinations and course of life of the Greeks and Romans Study well the temper and actions of the French and English You cannot be much mistaken in transferring to the former most of the observations which you have made with regard to the latter.",
            "Its chief use is only to discover the constant and universal principles of human nature by shewing men in all varieties of cir cumstances and situations and furnishing us with materials from which we may form our observations and become acquainted with the regular springs of human action and behaviour.",
            "These records of wars intrigues factions and revolutions are so many collections of experiments by which the politician or moral philosopher xes the principles of his science in the same manner as the physician or natural philosopher becomes acquainted with the nature of plants Section VIII 60 83 84 minerals and other external objects by the experiments which he forms concerning them.",
            "Should a traveller returning from a far country bring us an account of men wholly dierent from any with whom we were ever acquainted men who were entirely divested of avarice ambition or revenge who knew no pleasure but friendship generosity and public spirit we should immediately from these circumstances detect the falsehood and prove him a liar with the same certainty as if he had stued his narration with stories of centaurs and dragons miracles and prodigies.",
            "And if we would explode any forgery in history we cannot make use of a more convincing argument than to prove that the actions ascribed to any person are directly contrary to the course of nature and that no human motives in such circumstances could ever induce him to such a conduct.",
            "The veracity of Quintus Curtius is as much to be suspected when he describes the supernatural courage of Alexander by which he was hurried on singly to attack multitudes as when he describes his supernatural force and activity by which he was able to resist them.",
            "But were there no uniformity in human actions and were every experiment which we could form of this Of Liberty and Necessity 61 85 kind irregular and anomalous it were impossible to collect any gen eral observations concerning mankind and no experience however accurately digested by reection would ever serve to any purpose.",
            "Why is the aged husbandman more skilful in his calling than the young beginner but because there is a certain uniformity in the oper ation of the sun rain and earth towards the production of vegetables and experience teaches the old practitioner the rules by which this operation is governed and directed We must not however expect that this uniformity of human actions should be carried to such a length as that all men in the same circumstances will always act precisely in the same manner without making any allowance for the diversity of characters prejudices and opinions.",
            "Are the actions of the same person much diversied in the dierent periods of his life from infancy to old age This aords room for many general observa tions concerning the gradual change of our sentiments and inclinations and the dierent maxims which prevail in the dierent ages of human creatures.",
            "But philosophers observing that almost in every part of nature there is contained a vast variety of springs and principles which are hid by reason of their minuteness or remoteness nd that it is at least possible the contrari ety of events may not proceed from any contingency in the cause but from the secret operation of contrary causes.",
            "A peasant can give no better reason for the stopping of any clock or watch than to say that it does not commonly go right But an artist easily perceives that the same force in the spring or pendulum has always the same inuence on the wheels but fails of its usual eect perhaps by reason of a grain of dust which puts a stop to the whole movement.",
            "Thus for instance in the human body when the usual symp toms of health or sickness disappoint our expectation when medi cines operate not with their wonted powers when irregular events follow from any particular cause the philosopher and physician are not surprized at the matter nor are ever tempted to deny in general the necessity and uniformity of those principles by which the animal oeconomy is conducted.",
            "They know that a human body is a mighty complicated machine That many secret powers lurk in it which are altogether beyond our comprehension That to us it must often appear very uncertain in its operations And that therefore the irregular events which outwardly discover themselves can be no proof that the laws of nature are not observed with the greatest regularity in its internal operations and government.",
            "The internal principles and motives may operate in a uniform manner notwithstanding these seeming irregularities in the same manner as the winds rain clouds and other variations of the weather are supposed to be governed by steady principles though not easily discoverable by human sagacity and enquiry.",
            "Thus it appears not only that the conjunction between motives and voluntary actions is as regular and uniform as that between the cause and eect in any part of nature but also that this regular conjunction has been universally acknowledged among mankind and has never been the subject of dispute either in philosophy or common life.",
            "Now as it is from past experience that we draw all inferences concerning the future and as we conclude that objects will always be conjoined together which we nd to have always been conjoined it may seem superuous to prove that this experienced uniformity in human actions is a source whence we draw inferences concerning them.",
            "He also expects that when he carries his goods to market and oers them at a reasonable price he shall nd purchasers and shall be able by the money he acquires to engage others to supply him with those commodities which are requisite for his subsistence.",
            "In all these conclu sions they take their measures from past experience in the same manner as in their reasonings concerning external objects and rmly believe that men as well as all the elements are to continue in their operations the same that they have ever found them.",
            "What would become of history had we not a dependence on the veracity of the historian according to the experience which we have had of mankind How could politics be a science if laws and forms of government had not a uniform inuence upon society Where would be the foundation of morals if particular characters had no certain or determinate power to produce particular sentiments and if these sentiments had no constant operation on actions And with what pretence could we employ our criticism upon any poet or polite author if we could not pronounce the conduct and sentiments of his actors either natural or unnatural to such characters and in such circumstances It seems almost impossible therefore to engage either in science or action of any kind without acknowledging the doctrine of necessity and this inference from motives to voluntary actions from characters to conduct.",
            "A prisoner who has neither money nor interest discovers the impossibility of his escape as well when Of Liberty and Necessity 65 90 he considers the obstinacy of the gaoler as the walls and bars with which he is surrounded and in all attempts for his freedom chuses rather to work upon the stone and iron of the one than upon the inexible nature of the other.",
            "Here is a connected chain of natural causes and voluntary actions but the mind feels no dierence between them in passing from one link to another Nor is less certain of the future event than if it were connected with the objects present to the memory or senses by a train of causes cemented together by what we are pleased to call a physical necessity.",
            "I shall say that I know with certainty that he is not to put his hand into the re and hold it there till it be consumed And this event I think I can foretell with the same assurance as that if he throw himself out at the window and meet with no obstruction he will not remain a moment suspended in the air.",
            "Section VIII 66 91 I have frequently considered what could possibly be the reason why all mankind though they have ever without hesitation acknowledged the doctrine of necessity in their whole practice and reasoning have yet discovered such a reluctance to acknowledge it in words and have rather shewn a propensity in all ages to profess the contrary opinion.",
            "If we examine the operations of body and the production of eects from their causes we shall nd that all our faculties can never carry us farther in our knowledge of this relation than barely to observe that particular objects are constantly conjoined together and that the mind is carried by a customary transition from the appearance of one to the belief of the other.",
            "But though this conclusion concerning human ignorance be the result of the strictest scrutiny of this subject men still entertain a strong propensity to believe that they penetrate farther into the powers of nature and perceive something like a necessary connexion between the cause and the eect.",
            "When again they turn their reections towards the opera tions of their own minds and feel no such connexion of the motive and the action they are thence apt to suppose that there is a dierence between the eects which result from material force and those which arise from thought and intelligence.",
            "But being once convinced that we know nothing farther of causation of any kind than merely the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of the mind from one to another and nding that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have place in voluntary actions we may be more easily led to own the same necessity common to all causes.",
            "Of Liberty and Necessity 67 92 93 It would seem indeed that men begin at the wrong end of this question concerning liberty and necessity when they enter upon it by examining the faculties of the soul the inuence of the under standing and the operations of the will.",
            "Let them rst discuss a more simple question namely the operations of body and of brute unin telligent matter and try whether they can there form any idea of causation and necessity except that of a constant conjunction of objects and subsequent inference of the mind from one to another.",
            "If these circumstances form in reality the whole of that necessity which we conceive in matter and if these circumstances be also uni versally acknowledged to take place in the operations of the mind the dispute is at an end at least must be owned to be thenceforth merely verbal.",
            "But as long as we will rashly suppose that we have some farther idea of necessity and causation in the operations of external objects at the same time that we can nd nothing farther in the voluntary actions of the mind there is no possibility of bring ing the question to any determinate issue while we proceed upon so erroneous a supposition.",
            "For as it is evident that these have a regular con junction with motives and circumstances and characters and as we always draw inferences from one to the other we must be obliged to acknowledge in words that necessity which we have already avowed in every deliberation of our lives and in every step of our conduct an.",
            "But to proceed in this reconciling project with regard to the question of liberty and necessity the most contentious question of metaphysics the most contentious science it will not require many words to prove that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of liberty as well as in that of necessity and that the whole dispute in this respect also has been hitherto merely verbal.",
            "Now necessity in both these senses which indeed are at bottom the same has universally though tacitly in the schools in the pulpit and in common life been allowed to belong to the will of man and no one has ever pretended to deny that we can draw inferences concerning human actions and that those inferences are founded on the experienced union of like actions with like motives inclinations and circumstances.",
            "The only particu lar in which any one can dier is that either perhaps he will refuse to give the name of necessity to this property of human actions But as long as the meaning is understood I hope the word can do no harm Or that he will maintain it possible to discover something farther in the operations of matter.",
            "The actions themselves may be blameable they may be contrary to all the rules of morality and religion But the person is not answerable for them and as they proceeded from nothing in him that is durable and constant and leave nothing of that nature behind them it is impossible he can upon their account become the object of punishment or vengeance.",
            "According to the principle therefore which denies necessity and consequently causes a man is as pure and untainted after having committed the most horrid crime as at the rst moment of his birth nor is his character any wise concerned in his actions since they are not derived from it and the wickedness of the one can never be used as a proof of the depravity of the other.",
            "How is this to be accounted for but by asserting that actions render a person criminal merely as they are proofs of criminal principles in the mind and when by an alteration of these principles they cease to be just proofs they likewise cease to be criminal.",
            "Of Liberty and Necessity 71 99 It will be equally easy to prove and from the same arguments that liberty according to that denition above mentioned in which all men agree is also essential to morality and that no human actions where it is wanting are susceptible of any moral qualities or can be the objects either of approbation or dislike.",
            "For as actions are objects of our moral sentiment so far only as they are indications of the internal character passions and aections it is impossible that they can give rise either to praise or blame where they proceed not from these prin ciples but are derived altogether from external violence.",
            "It may be said for instance that if voluntary actions be subjected to the same laws of necessity with the operations of matter there is a continued chain of necessary causes preordained and predetermined reaching from the original cause of all to every single volition of every human creature.",
            "For as a man who red a mine is answerable for all the consequences whether the train he employed be long or short so wherever a continued chain of necessary causes is xed that Being either nite or innite who produces the rst is likewise the author of all the rest and must both bear the blame and acquire the praise which belong to them.",
            "This objection consists of two parts which we shall examine separately First that if human actions can be traced up by a neces sary chain to the Deity they can never be criminal on account of the innite perfection of that Being from whom they are derived and who can intend nothing but what is altogether good and laudable.",
            "There are many philosophers who after an exact scrutiny of all the phaenomena of nature conclude that the Whole considered as one system is in every period of its existence ordered with perfect benevolence and that the utmost possible happiness will in the end result to all created beings without any mixture of positive or absolute ill and misery.",
            "From this theory some philosophers and the ancient Stoics among the rest derived a topic of consolation under all afictions while they taught their pupils that those ills under which they laboured were in reality goods to the universe and that to an enlarged view which could comprehend the whole system of nature every event became an object of joy and exultation.",
            "You would surely more irritate than appease a man lying under the racking pains of the gout by preaching up to him the rectitude of those general laws which produced the malignant humours in his body and led them through the proper canals to the sinews and nerves where they now excite such acute torments.",
            "These enlarged views may for a moment please the imagination of a speculative man who is placed in ease and security but neither can they dwell with constancy on his mind even Of Liberty and Necessity 73 101 though undisturbed by the emotions of pain or passion much less can they maintain their ground when attacked by such powerful antagonists.",
            "The characters which engage our approbation are chiey such as con tribute to the peace and security of human society as the characters which excite blame are chiey such as tend to public detriment and disturbance Whence it may reasonably be presumed that the moral sentiments arise either mediately or immediately from a reection on these opposite interests.",
            "What though philosophical meditations estab lish a dierent opinion or conjecture that every thing is right with regard to the whole and that the qualities which disturb society are in the main as benecial and are as suitable to the primary intention of nature as those which more directly promote its happiness and welfare Are such remote and uncertain speculations able to counterbalance the sentiments which arise from the natural and immediate view of the objects a man who is robbed of a considerable sum does he nd his vexation for the loss any wise diminished by these sublime reections Why then should his moral resentment against the crime be supposed incompatible with them Or why should not the acknowledgment of a real distinction between vice and virtue be reconcileable to all specu lative systems of philosophy as well as that of a real distinction between personal beauty and deformity Both these distinctions are founded in the natural sentiments of the human mind And these sentiments are not to be controuled or altered by any philosophical theory or specula tion whatsoever.",
            "These are mysteries which mere natural Section VIII 74 102 103 and unassisted reason is very unt to handle and whatever system she embraces she must nd herself involved in inextricable diculties and even contradictions at every step which she takes with regard to such subjects.",
            "Happy if she be thence sensible of her temerity when she pries into these sublime mysteries and leaving a scene so full of obscurities and perplexities return with suitable modesty to her true and proper province the examination of common life where she will nd diculties enow to employ her enquiries without launching into so boundless an ocean of doubt uncertainty and contradiction Of Liberty and Necessity 75 SECTION IX Of the Reason of Animals a ll our reasonings concerning matter of fact are founded on a species of Analogy which leads us to expect from any cause the same events which we have observed to result from similar causes.",
            "Where the causes are entirely similar the analogy is perfect and the inference drawn from it is regarded as certain and conclusive Nor does any man ever entertain a doubt where he sees a piece of iron that it will have weight and cohesion of parts as in all other instances which have ever fallen under his observation.",
            "The anatomical observations formed upon one animal are by this species of reasoning extended to all animals and it is certain that when the circulation of the blood for instance is clearly proved to have place in one creature as a frog or sh it forms a strong presumption that the same principle has place in all.",
            "These analogical observations may be carried farther even to this science of which we are now treating and any theory by which we explain the operations of the understanding or the origin and connex ion of the passions in man will acquire additional authority if we nd that the same theory is requisite to explain the same phaenomena in all other animals.",
            "An old greyhound will trust the more fatiguing part of the chace to the younger and will place himself so as to meet the hare in her doubles nor are the conjectures which he forms on this occasion founded in any thing but his observation and experience.",
            "Is it not experience which renders a dog apprehensive of pain when you menace him or lift up the whip to beat him Is it not even experience which makes him answer to his name and infer from such an arbitrary sound that you mean him rather than any of his fellows and intend to call him when you pronounce it in a certain manner and with a certain tone and accent In all these cases we may observe that the animal infers some fact beyond what immediately strikes his senses and that this inference is altogether founded on past experience while the creature expects from the present object the same consequences which it has always found in its observation to result from similar objects.",
            "Animals therefore are not guided in these inferences by reasoning Neither are children Neither are the generality of mankind in their ordinary actions and conclusions Neither are philosophers themselves who in all the active parts of life are in the main the same with the vulgar and are governed by the same maxims.",
            "Were this doubtful with regard to men it seems Of the Reason of Animals 77 106 to admit of no question with regard to the brute creation and the conclusion being once rmly established in the one we have a strong presumption from all the rules of analogy that it ought to be univer sally admitted without any exception or reserve.",
            "But though animals learn many parts of their knowledge from observation there are also many parts of it which they derive from the original hand of nature which much exceed the share of capacity they possess on ordinary occasions and in which they improve little or nothing by the longest practice and experience.",
            "But our wonder will perhaps cease or diminish when we consider that the experimental reasoning itself which we possess in common with beasts and on which the whole conduct of life depends is nothing but a species of instinct or mechanical power that acts in us unknown to ourselves and in its chief operations is not directed by any such relations or comparisons of ideas as are the proper objects of our intellectual faculties.",
            "Our evidence then for the truth of the Christian religion is less than the evidence for the truth of our senses because even in the rst authors of our religion it was no greater and it is evident it must diminish in passing from them to their dis ciples nor can any one rest such condence in their testimony as in the immediate object of his senses.",
            "It contradicts sense though both the scripture and tradition on which it is supposed to be built carry not such evidence with them as sense when they are considered merely as external evidences and are not brought home to every ones breast by the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit.",
            "Some events are found in all countries and all ages to have been constantly conjoined together Others are found to have been more variable and sometimes to disappoint our expectations so that in our reasonings concerning matter of fact there are all imaginable degrees of assurance from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence.",
            "In other cases he proceeds with more caution He weighs the opposite experiments He considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments To that side he inclines with doubt and hesi tation and when at last he xes his judgment the evidence exceeds not what we properly call probability.",
            "It will be sucient to observe that our assurance in any argument of this kind is derived from no other principle than our 80 111 Of Miracles observation of the veracity of human testimony and of the usual con formity of facts to the reports of witnesses.",
            "It being a general maxim that no objects have any discoverable connexion together and that all the inferences which we can draw from one to another are founded merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction it is evident that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony whose connexion with any event seems in itself as little necessary as any other.",
            "Were not the memory tenacious to a certain degree had not men commonly an inclination to truth and a principle of probity were they not sensible to shame when detected in a falsehood Were not these I say discovered by experience to be qualities inherent in human nature we should never repose the least condence in human testimony.",
            "And as the evidence derived from witnesses and human testi mony is founded on past experience so it varies with the experience and is regarded either as a proof or a probability according as the con junction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object has been found to be constant or variable.",
            "This contrariety of evidence in the present case may be derived from several dierent causes from the opposition of contrary testimony from the character or number of the witnesses from the manner of their delivering their testimony or from the union of all these circum stances.",
            "We entertain a suspicion concerning any matter of fact when the witnesses contradict each other when they are but few or of a doubtful character when they have an interest in what they arm when they deliver their testimony with hesitation or on the contrary with too violent asseverations.",
            "Suppose for instance that the fact which the testimony endeav ours to establish partakes of the extraordinary and the marvellous in that case the evidence resulting from the testimony admits of a diminution greater or less in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual.",
            "But when the fact attested is such a one as has seldom fallen under our observation here is a contest of two opposite experi ences of which the one destroys the other as far as its force goes and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force which remains.",
            "The very same principle of experience which gives us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of witnesses gives us also in this case another degree of assurance against the fact which they endeavour to establish from which contradiction there necessarily arises a counter poize and mutual destruction of belief and authority.",
            "The Indian prince who refused to believe the rst relations concerning the eects of frost reasoned justly and it naturally required very strong testimony to engage his assent to facts that arose from a state of nature with which he was unacquainted and which bore so little analogy to those events of which he had had constant and uniform experience.",
            "But in order to encrease the probability against the testimony of witnesses let us suppose that the fact which they arm instead of being only marvellous is really miraculous and suppose also that the testimony considered apart and in itself amounts to an entire proof in that case there is proof against proof of which the strongest must prevail but still with a diminution of its force in proportion to that of its antagonist.",
            "Of Miracles 83 a miracle is a violation of the laws of nature and as a rm and unalterable experience has established these laws the proof against a miracle from the very nature of the fact is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined.",
            "Why is it more than prob able that all men must die that lead cannot of itself remain suspended in the air that re consumes wood and is extinguished by water unless it be that these events are found agreeable to the laws of nature and there is required a violation of these laws or in other words a miracle to prevent them Nothing is esteemed a miracle if it ever happen in the common course of nature.",
            "And as an uniform experience amounts to a proof there is here a direct and full proof from the nature of the fact against the existence of any miracle nor can such a proof be destroyed or the miracle rendered credible but by an opposite proof which i.",
            "The plain consequence is and it is a general maxim worthy of our attention That no testimony is sucient to establish a mir acle unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish And even in that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force which remains after deducting the inferior.",
            "Section X 84 PART II In the foregoing reasoning we have supposed that the testimony upon which a miracle is founded may possibly amount to an entire proof and that the falsehood of that testimony would be a real prodigy But it is easy to shew that we have been a great deal too lib eral in our concession and that there never was a miraculous event established on so full an evidence.",
            "For rst there is not to be found in all history any miracle attested by a sucient number of men of such unquestioned good sense education and learning as to secure us against all delusion in themselves of such undoubted integrity as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others of such credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being detected in any falsehood and at the same time attesting facts performed in such a public manner and in so celebrated a part of the world as to render the detection unavoidable All which circumstances are requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men.",
            "The maxim by which we commonly conduct ourselves in our reason ings is that the objects of which we have no experience resemble those of which we have that what we have found to be most usual is always most probable and that where there is an opposition of argu ments we ought to give the preference to such as are founded on the greatest number of past observations.",
            "But though in proceeding by this rule we readily reject any fact which is unusual and incredible in an ordinary degree yet in advancing farther the mind observes not always the same rule but when any thing is armed utterly absurd and miraculous it rather the more readily admits of such a fact upon account of that very circumstance which ought to destroy all its authority.",
            "And this goes so far that even those who cannot enjoy this pleasure immediately nor can believe those miraculous events of which they are informed yet love to partake of the satisfaction at secondhand or by rebound and place a pride and delight in exciting the admiration of others.",
            "A religionist may be an enthusiast and imagine he sees what has no reality He may know his narrative to be false and yet persevere in it with the best intentions in the world for the sake of promoting so holy a cause Or even where this delusion has not place vanity excited by so strong a temptation operates on him more powerfully than on the rest of mankind in any other cir cumstances and selfinterest with equal force.",
            "His auditors may not have and commonly have not sucient judgment to canvass his evi dence What judgment they have they renounce by principle in these sublime and mysterious subjects Or if they were ever so willing to employ it passion and a heated imagination disturb the regularity of its operations.",
            "The many instances of forged miracles and prophecies and supernatural events which in all ages have either been detected by contrary evidence or which detect themselves by their absurdity prove suciently the strong propensity of mankind to the extraordin ary and the marvellous and ought reasonably to beget a suspicion against all relations of this kind.",
            "For instance There is no kind of report which rises so easily and spreads so quickly especially in country places and provincial towns as those concerning marriages insomuch that two young persons of equal condition never see each other twice but the whole neighbourhood immediately join them together.",
            "It forms a strong presumption against all supernatural and miraculous relations that they are observed chiey to abound among ignorant and barbarous nations or if a civilized people has ever given admission to any of them that people will be found to have received them from ignorant and barbarous ancestors who transmitted them with that inviolable sanction and authority which always attend received opinions.",
            "But as the former grow thinner every page in proportion as we advance nearer the enlightened ages we soon learn that there is noth ing mysterious or supernatural in the case but that all proceeds from the usual propensity of mankind towards the marvellous and that though this inclination may at intervals receive a check from sense and learning it can never be thoroughly extirpated from human nature.",
            "It was a wise policy in that false prophet Alexander who though now forgotten was once so famous to lay the rst scene of his impostures in Paphlagonia where as Lucian tells us the people were extremely ignorant and stupid and ready to swallow even the grossest delusion.",
            "And thus the impostor abovementioned was enabled to proceed from his ignorant Paphlagonians to the enlisting of votaries even among the Grecian philosophers and men of the most eminent rank and distinction in Rome Nay could engage the attention of that sage emperor Marcus Aurelius so far as to make him trust the success of a military expedition to his delusive prophecies.",
            "The advantages are so great of starting an imposture among an ignorant people that even though the delusion should be too gross to impose on the generality of them which though seldom is sometimes the case it has a much better chance for succeeding in remote countries than if the rst scene had been laid in a city renowned for arts and knowledge.",
            "But had Alexander xed his residence at Athens the philosophers of that renowned mart of learning had immediately spread throughout the whole Roman empire their sense of the matter which being supported by so great authority and displayed by all the force of reason and eloquence had entirely opened the eyes of mankind.",
            "I may add as a fourth reason which diminishes the authority of prodigies that there is no testimony for any even those which have not been expressly detected that is not opposed by an innite number of witnesses so that not only the miracle destroys the credit of testimony but the testimony destroys itself.",
            "To make this the better understood let us consider that in matters of religion whatever is 87 121 Section X 88 dierent is contrary and that it is impossible the religions of ancient Rome of Turkey of Siam and of China should all of them be established on any solid foundation.",
            "Every miracle therefore pre tended to have been wrought in any of these religions and all of them abound in miracles as its direct scope is to establish the particular system to which it is attributed so has it the same force though more indirectly to overthrow every other system.",
            "In destroying a rival system it likewise destroys the credit of those miracles on which that system was established so that all the prodigies of dierent reli gions are to be regarded as contrary facts and the evidences of these prodigies whether weak or strong as opposite to each other.",
            "According to this method of reasoning when we believe any miracle of Mahomet or his successors we have for our warrant the testimony of a few bar barous Arabians And on the other hand we are to regard the authority of Titus Livius Plutarch Tacitus and in short of all the authors and witnesses Grecian Chinese and Roman Catholic who have related any miracle in their particular religion I say we are to regard their testimony in the same light as if they had mentioned that Mahometan miracle and had in express terms contradicted it with the same certainty as they have for the miracle they relate.",
            "This argument may appear over subtile and rened but is not in reality dierent from the reasoning of a judge who supposes that the credit of two witnesses maintaining a crime against any one is destroyed by the testimony of two others who arm him to have been two hundred leagues distant at the same instant when the crime is said to have been committed.",
            "One of the best attested miracles in all profane history is that which Tacitus reports of Vespasian who cured a blind man in Alexandria by means of his spittle and a lame man by the mere touch of his foot in obedience to a vision of the god Serapis who had enjoined them to have recourse to the Emperor for these miracu lous cures.",
            "The story may be seen in that ne where every circumstance seems to add weight to the testimony and might be displayed at large with all the force of argument and eloquence if any one were now concerned to enforce the evidence of that exploded and idolatrous superstition.",
            "The historian a cotemporary writer noted for candour and veracity and withal the greatest and most penetrating genius perhaps of all antiquity and so free from any tendency to credulity that he even lies under the contrary imputation of atheism and pro faneness The persons from whose authority he related the miracle of established character for judgment and veracity as we may well presume eyewitnesses of the fact and conrming their testimony after the Flavian family was despoiled of the empire and could no longer give any reward as the price of a lie.",
            "When that intriguing politician ed into Spain to avoid the persecution of his enemies he passed through Saragossa the capital of Arragon where he was shewn in the cathedral a man who had served seven years as a door keeper and was well known to every body in town that had ever paid his devotions at that church.",
            "Here the relater was also cotemporary to the supposed prodigy of an incredulous and libertine character as well as of great genius the miracle of so singular a nature as could scarcely admit of a counterfeit and the witnesses very numerous and all of them in a manner spectators of the fact to which they gave their tes timony.",
            "And what adds mightily to the force of the evidence and may double our surprize on this occasion is that the cardinal himself who relates the story seems not to give any credit to it and consequently cannot be suspected of any concurrence in the holy fraud.",
            "He consid ered justly that it was not requisite in order to reject a fact of this nature to be able accurately to disprove the testimony and to trace its falsehood through all the circumstances of knavery and credulity which 89 124 Section X 90 produced it.",
            "Nor is this all a relation of them was published and dispersed every where nor were the Jesuits though a learned body supported by the civil magistrate and deter mined enemies to those opinions in whose favour the miracles were said to have been wrought ever able distinctly to refute or detec.",
            "Where shall we nd such a number of circumstances agreeing to the corroboration of one fact And what have we to oppose to such a cloud of witnesses but the absolute impossibility or miraculous nature of the events which they relate And this surely in the eyes of all reasonable people will alone be regarded as a sucient refutation.",
            "Is the consequence just because some human testimony has the utmost force and authority in some cases when it relates the battle of Philippi or Pharsalia for instance that therefore all kinds of testimony must in all cases have equal force and authority Suppose that the Caesarean and Pompeian factions had each of them claimed the victory in these battles and that the historians of each party had uniformly ascribed the advantage to their own side how could mankind at this distance have been able to determine between them The contrariety is equally strong between the miracles related by Herodotus or Plutarch and those delivered by Mariana Bede or any monkish historian.",
            "But what greater temptation than to appear a missionary a prophet an ambassador from heaven Who would not encounter many dangers and diculties in order to attain so sublime a character Or if by the help of vanity and a heated imag ination a man has rst made a convert of himself and entered seri ously into the delusion who ever scruples to make use of pious frauds in support of so holy and meritorious a cause The smallest spark may here kindle into the greatest ame because the materials are always prepared for it.",
            "How many stories of this nature have in all ages been detected and exploded in their infancy How many more have been celebrated for a time and have afterwards sunk into neglect and oblivion Where such reports therefore y about the solution of the phaenomenon is obvious and we judge in conformity to regular experience and obser vation when we account for it by the known and natural principles of credulity and delusion.",
            "And shall we rather than have a recourse to so natural a solution allow of a miraculous violation of the most estab lished laws of nature I need not mention the diculty of detecting a falsehood in any private or even public history at the place where it is said to happen much more when the scene is removed to ever so small a dis tance.",
            "Upon the whole then it appears that no testimony for any kind of miracle has ever amounted to a probability much less to a proof and that even supposing it amounted to a proof it would be opposed by another proof derived from the very nature of the fact which it would endeavour to establish.",
            "But according to the principle here explained this substraction with regard to all popular religions amounts to an entire annihilation and therefore we may establish it as a maxim that no human testimony can have such force as to prove a miracle and make it a just foundation for any such system of religion.",
            "For I own that otherwise there may possibly be miracles or violations of the usual course of nature of such a kind as to admit of proof from human testimony though perhaps it will be impossible to nd any such in all the records of history.",
            "Thus suppose all authors in all languages agree that from the rst of January there was a total darkness over the whole earth for eight days Suppose that the tradition of this extraordinary event is still strong and lively among the people That all travellers who return from foreign countries bring us accounts of the same tradition without the least variation or contradiction It is evident that our present philosophers instead of doubting the fact ought to receive it as certain and ought to Search for the causes whence it might be derived.",
            "But suppose that all the historians who treat of England should agree that on the rst of January Queen Elizabeth 127 128 Of Miracles died that both before and after her death she was seen by her physi cians and the whole court as is usual with persons of her rank that her successor was acknowledged and proclaimed by the parliament and that after being interred a month she again appeared resumed the throne and governed England for three years I must confess that I should be surprized at the concurrence of so many odd circum stances but should not have the least inclination to believe so miracu lous an event.",
            "You would in vain object to me the diculty and almost impos sibility of deceiving the world in an aair of such consequence the wisdom and solid judgment of that renowned queen with the little or no advantage which she could reap from so poor an artice All this might astonish me but I would still reply that the knavery and folly of men are such common phaenomena that I should rather believe the most extraordinary events to arise from their concurrence than admit of so signal a violation of the laws of nature.",
            "But should this miracle be ascribed to any new system of religion men in all ages have been so much imposed on by ridicu lous stories of that kind that this very circumstance would be a full proof of a cheat and sucient with all men of sense not only to make them reject the fact but even reject it without farther exami nation.",
            "Though the Being to whom the miracle is ascribed be in this case Almighty it does not upon that account become a whit more probable since it is impossible for us to know the attributes or actions of such a Being otherwise than from the experience which we have of his productions in the usual course of nature.",
            "This still reduces us to past observation and obliges us to compare the instances of the viola tion of truth in the testimony of men with those of the violation of the laws of nature by miracles in order to judge which of them is most likely and probable.",
            "As the violations of truth are more common in the testimony concerning religious miracles than in that concerning any other matter of fact this must diminish very much the authority of the former testimony and make us form a general resolution never to lend any attention to it with whatever specious pretence it may be covered.",
            "Above all every relation must be considered as suspicious which depends in any degree upon religion as the prodigies of Livy And no less so every thing that is to be found in the writers of natural magic or alchimy or such authors who seem all of them to have an uncon querable appetite for falsehood and fable 27.",
            "To make this more evident let us examine those miracles related in scripture and not to lose ourselves in too wide a eld let us conne ourselves to such as we nd in the Pentateuch which we shall examine according to the principles of these pretended Christians not as the word or testimony of God himself but as the production of a mere human writer and historian.",
            "Here then we are rst to consider a book presented to us by a barbarous and ignorant people written in an age when they were still more barbarous and in all probability long after the facts which it relates corroborated by no concurring testimony and resembling those fabulous accounts which every nation gives of its origin.",
            "It gives an account of a state of the world and of human nature entirely dierent from the present Of our fall from that state Of the age of man extended to near a thousand years Of the destruction of the world by a deluge Of the arbitrary choice of one people as the favourites of heaven and that people the countrymen of the author Of their deliv erance from bondage by prodigies the most astonishing imaginable I desire any one to lay his hand upon his heart and after a serious consideration declare whether he thinks that the falsehood of such a book supported by such a testimony would be more extraordinary and miraculous than all the miracles it relates which is however nec essary to make it be received according to the measures of probability above established.",
            "Mere reason is insucient to convince us of its veracity And whoever is moved by Faith to assent to it is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person which subverts all the prin ciples of his understanding and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience.",
            "Our conversation began with my admiring the singular good fortune of philosophy which as it requires entire liberty above all other privileges and chiey ourishes from the free opposition of sentiments and argumentation received its rst birth in an age and country of freedom and toleration and was never cramped even in its most extravagant principles by any creeds confessions or penal statutes.",
            "Epicurus lived at Athens to an advanced age in peace and tranquillity were even admitted to receive the sacerdotal character and to ociate at the altar in the most sacred rites of the established religion And the public of pensions and salaries was aorded equally by the wisest of all the Roman to the professors of every sect of philosophy.",
            "How requisite such kind of treatment was to philosophy in her early youth will easily be conceived if we reect that even at present when she may be supposed more hardy and robust she bears with much diculty the inclemency of the seasons and those harsh winds of calumny and persecution which blow upon her.",
            "Speculative dogmas of religion the present occasions of such furious dispute could not possibly be conceived or admitted in the early ages of the world when mankind being wholly illiterate formed an idea of religion more suitable to their weak apprehension and composed their sacred tenets of such tales chiey as were the objects of traditional belief more than of argument or disputation.",
            "After the rst alarm therefore was over which arose from the new paradoxes and principles of the philosophers these teachers seem ever after during the ages of antiquity to have lived in great harmony with the established superstition and to have made a fair partition of mankind between them the former claiming all the learned and wise the latter possessing all the vulgar and illiterate.",
            "It seems then say I that you leave politics entirely out of the question and never suppose that a wise magistrate can justly be jeal ous of certain tenets of philosophy such as those of Epicurus which denying a divine existence and consequently a providence and a future state seem to loosen in a great measure the ties of morality and may be supposed for that reason pernicious to the peace of civil society.",
            "But what if I should advance farther and assert that if Epicurus had been accused before the people by any of the syco phants or informers of those days he could easily have defended his cause and proved his principles of philosophy to be as salutary as those of his adversaries who endeavoured with such zeal to expose him to the public hatred and jealousy I wish said I you would try your eloquence upon so extraor dinary a topic and make a speech for Epicurus which might satisfy not the mob of Athens if you will allow that ancient and polite city to have contained any mob but the more philosophical part of his audience such as might be supposed capable of comprehending his arguments.",
            "And if I can persuade you that they are entirely indierent to the peace of society and security of govern ment I hope that you will presently send us back to our schools there to examine at leisure the question the most sublime but at the same time the most speculative of all philosophy.",
            "The religious philosophers not satised with the tradition of your forefathers and doctrine of your priests in which I willingly acquiesce indulge a rash curiosity in trying how far they can estab lish religion upon the principles of reason and they thereby excite instead of satisfying the doubts which naturally arise from a diligent and scrutinous enquiry.",
            "They paint in the most magnicent colours the order beauty and wise arrangement of the universe and then ask if such a glorious display of intelligence could proceed from the fortuitous concourse of atoms or if chance could produce what the greatest genius can never suciently admire.",
            "It is sucient if I can prove from this very reasoning that the question is entirely speculative and that when in my philosophical disquisitions I deny a providence and a future state I undermine not the foundations of society but advance principles which they themselves upon their own topics if they argue consistently must allow to be solid and satisfactory.",
            "You then who are my accusers have acknowledged that the chief or sole argument for a divine existence which I never questioned 135 Of a Providence and Future State 99 is derived from the order of nature where there appear such marks of intelligence and design that you think it extravagant to assign for its cause either chance or the blind and unguided force of matter.",
            "If the cause be known only by the eect we never ought to ascribe to it any quali ties beyond what are precisely requisite to produce the eect Nor can we by any rules of just reasoning return back from the cause and infer other eects from it beyond those by which alone it is known to us.",
            "Allowing therefore the gods to be the authors of the existence or order of the universe it follows that they possess that precise 136 137 Section XI degree of power intelligence and benevolence which appears in their workmanship but nothing farther can ever be proved except we call in the assistance of exaggeration and attery to supply the defects of argument and reasoning.",
            "The supposition of farther attributes is mere hypothesis much more the supposition that in distant regions of space or periods of time there has been or will be a more magnicent display of these attributes and a scheme of administration more suitable to such imaginary virtues.",
            "We can never be allowed to mount up from the universe the eect to Jupiter the cause and then descend downwards to infer any new eect from that cause as if the present eects alone were not entirely worthy of the glorious attributes which we ascribe to that deity.",
            "I ask who carried them into the celestial regions who admitted them into the councils of the gods who opened to them the book of fate that they thus rashly arm that their deities have executed or will execute any purpose 100 138 Of a Providence and Future State beyond what has actually appeared If they tell me that they have mounted on the steps or by the gradual ascent of reason and by drawing inferences from eects to causes I still insist that they have aided the ascent of reason by the wings of imagination otherwise they could not thus change their manner of inference and argue from causes to eects presuming that a more perfect production than the present world would be more suitable to such perfect beings as the gods and forgetting that they have no reason to ascribe to these celestial beings any perfection or any attribute but what can be found in the present world.",
            "The obstinate and intractable qualities of matter we are told or the observance of general laws or some such reason is the sole cause which controlled the power and benevolence of Jupiter and obliged him to create mankind and every sensible creature so imperfect and so unhappy.",
            "But still I ask Why take these attributes for granted or why ascribe to the cause any qualities but what actually appear in the eect Why torture your brain to justify the course of nature upon suppositions which for aught you know may be entirely imaginary and of which there are to be found no traces in the course of nature The religious hypothesis therefore must be considered only as a particular method of accounting for the visible phaenomena of the universe But no just reasoner will ever presume to infer from it any single fact and alter or add to the phaenomena in any single particular.",
            "If you come backward and arguing from your inferred causes conclude that any other fact has existed or will exist in the course of nature which may serve as a fuller display of particular attributes I must admonish you that you have departed from the method of reasoning attached to the present subject and have 101 139 Section XI certainly added something to the attributes of the cause beyond what appears in the eect otherwise you could never with tolerable sense or propriety add any thing to the eect in order to render it more worthy of the cause.",
            "Where then is the odiousness of that doctrine which I teach in my school or rather which I examine in my gardens Or what do you nd in this whole question wherein the security of good morals or the peace and order of society is in the least concerned I deny a providence you say and supreme governour of the world who guides the course of events and punishes the vicious with infamy and disappointment and rewards the virtuous with honour and success in all their undertakings.",
            "And if you arm that while a divine providence is allowed and a supreme distributive justice in the universe I ought to expect some more particular reward of the good and punishment of the bad beyond the ordinary course of events I here nd the same fallacy which I have before endeavoured to detect.",
            "You seem not to remember that all your reasonings on this subject can only be drawn from eects to causes and that every argument deduced from causes to eects must of necessity be a gross sophism since it is impossible for you to know 102 140 141 Of a Providence and Future State any thing of the cause but what you have antecedently not inferred but discovered to the full in the eect.",
            "But what must a philosopher think of those vain reasoners who instead of regarding the present scene of things as the sole object of their contemplation so far reverse the whole course of nature as to render this life merely a passage to something farther a porch which leads to a greater and vastly dierent building a prologue which serves only to introduce the piece and give it more grace and propriety Whence do you think can such philosophers derive their idea of the gods From their own conceit and imagina tion surely.",
            "If you hold a medium between armation and negation by saying that the justice of the gods at present exerts itself in part but not in its full extent I answer that you have no reason to give it any particular extent but only so far as you see it at present exert itself.",
            "It is useless because our knowledge of this cause being derived entirely from the course of 103 142 Section XI nature we can never according to the rules of just reasoning return back from the cause with any new inference or making additions to the common and experienced course of nature establish any new principles of conduct and behaviour.",
            "I observe said I nding he had nished his harangue that you neglect not the artice of the demagogues of old and as you were pleased to make me stand for the people you insinuate yourself into my favour by embracing those principles to which you know I have always expressed a particular attachment.",
            "But allowing you to make experience as indeed I think you ought the only standard of our judgment concerning this and all other questions of fact I doubt not but from the very same experience to which you appeal it may be possible to refute this reasoning which you have put into the mouth of Epicurus.",
            "If you saw for instance a halfnished build ing surrounded with heaps of brick and stone and mortar and all the instruments of masonry could you not infer from the eect that it was a work of design and contrivance And could you not return again from this inferred cause to infer new additions to the eect and conclude that the building would soon be nished and receive all the further improvements which art could bestow upon it If you saw upon the seashore the print of one human foot you would con clude that a man had passed that way and that he had also left the traces of the other foot though eaced by the rolling of the sands or inundation of the waters.",
            "Why then do you refuse to admit the same method of reasoning with regard to the order of nature Consider the world and the present life only as an imperfect building from which you can infer a superior intelligence and arguing from that superior intelligence which can leave nothing imperfect why may you not infer a more nished scheme or plan which will receive its comple tion in some distant point of space or time Are not these methods of reasoning exactly similar And under what pretence can you embrace the one while you reject the other The innite dierence of the subjects replied he is a sucient foundation for this dierence in my conclusions.",
            "But what is the foundation of this method of reasoning Plainly this that man is a 104 143 Of a Providence and Future State being whom we know by experience whose motives and designs we are acquainted with and whose projects and inclinations have a certain connexion and coherence according to the laws which nature has established for the government of such a creature.",
            "When there fore we nd that any work has proceeded from the skill and indus try of man as we are otherwise acquainted with the nature of the animal we can draw a hundred inferences concerning what may be expected from him and these inferences will all be founded in experi ence and observation.",
            "But did we know man only from the single work or production which we examine it were impossible for us to argue in this manner because our knowledge of all the qualities which we ascribe to him being in that case derived from the production it is impossible they could point to any thing farther or be the foundation of any new inference.",
            "The print of a foot in the sand can only prove when considered alone that there was some gure adapted to it by which it was produced But the print of a human foot proves likewise from our other experience that there was probably another foot which also left its impression though eaced by time or other accidents.",
            "The great source of our mistake in this subject and of the unbounded licence of conjecture which we indulge is that we tacitly consider ourselves as in the place of the Supreme Being and conclude that he will on every occasion observe the same conduct which we ourselves in his situation would have embraced as reasonable and eligible.",
            "But besides that the ordinary course of nature may convince us that almost every thing is regulated by principles and maxims very dierent from ours besides this I say it must evidently appear contrary to all rules of analogy to reason from the intentions and projects of men to those of a Being so dierent and so much supe rior.",
            "In human nature there is a certain experienced coherence of designs and inclinations so that when from any fact we have dis covered one intention of any man it may often be reasonable from experience to infer another and draw a long chain of conclusions concerning his past or future conduct.",
            "But this method of reasoning can never have place with regard to a Being so remote and incom prehensible who bears much less analogy to any other being in the universe than the sun to a waxen taper and who discovers himself only by some faint traces or outlines beyond which we have no authority to ascribe to him any attribute or perfection.",
            "All the philosophy therefore in the world and all the religion which is nothing but a species of philosophy will never be able to carry us beyond the usual course of experience or give us measures of conduct and behaviour dierent from those which are furnished by reections on common life.",
            "You conclude that religious doctrines and reasonings can have no inuence on life because they ought to have no inuence never considering that men reason not in the same manner you do but draw many consequences from the belief of a divine Existence and suppose that the Deity will inict punishments on vice and bestow rewards on virtue beyond what appear in the ordinary course of nature.",
            "And those who attempt to disabuse them of such prejudices may for aught I know be good reasoners but I cannot allow them to be good citizens and politicians since they free men from one restraint upon their pas sions and make the infringement of the laws of society in one respect more easy and secure.",
            "There is no enthusiasm among philosophers their doctrines are not very alluring to the people and no restraint can be put upon their reasonings but what must be of dangerous consequence to the sciences and even to the state by paving the way for persecution and oppression in points where the generality of mankind are more deeply interested and concerned.",
            "In a word I much doubt whether it be possible for a cause to be known only by its eect as you have all along supposed or to be of so singular and particular a nature as to have no parallel and no similarity with any other cause or object that has ever fallen under our observation.",
            "It is only when two species of objects are found to be constantly conjoined that we can infer the one from the other and were an eect presented which was entirely singular and could not be comprehended under 107 147 148 Section XI 108 any known species I do not see that we could form any conjecture or inference at all concerning its cause.",
            "If experience and observation and analogy be indeed the only guides which we can reasonably follow in inferences of this nature both the eect and cause must bear a similar ity and resemblance to other eects and causes which we know and which we have found in many instances to be conjoined with each other.",
            "I shall just observe that as the antagonists of Epicurus always suppose the universe an eect quite singular and unparalleled to be the proof of a Deity a cause no less singular and unparalleled your reasonings upon that supposition seem at least to merit our attention.",
            "SECTION XII Of the Academical or Sceptical Philosophy PART I T here is not a greater number of philosophical reasonings dis played upon any subject than those which prove the existence of a Deity and refute the fallacies of Atheists and yet the most reli gious philosophers still dispute whether any man can be so blinded as to be a speculative atheist.",
            "The Sceptic is another enemy of religion who naturally pro vokes the indignation of all divines and graver philosophers though it is certain that no man ever met with any such absurd creature or conversed with a man who had no opinion or principle concerning any subject either of action or speculation.",
            "This begets a very natu ral question What is meant by a sceptic And how far it is possible to push these philosophical principles of doubt and uncertainty There is a species of scepticism antecedent to all study and philosophy which is much inculcated by Des Cartes and others as a sovereign preservative against error and precipitate judgment.",
            "It recommends an universal doubt not only of all our former opinions and principles but also of our very faculties of whose veracity say they we must assure ourselves by a chain of reasoning deduced from some original principle which cannot possibly be fallacious or deceitful.",
            "But neither is there any such original principle which has a prerogative above others that are selfevident and convincing Or if there were could we advance a step beyond it but by the use of those very faculties of which we are supposed to be already dident.",
            "It must however be confessed that this species of scepticism when more moderate may be understood in a very reasonable sense 149 150 Section XII and is a necessary preparative to the study of philosophy by preserving a proper impartiality in our judgments and weaning our mind from all those prejudices which we may have imbibed from education or rash opinion.",
            "To begin with clear and selfevident principles to advance by timorous and sure steps to review frequently our conclusions and examine accurately all their consequences though by these means we shall make both a slow and a short progress in our systems are the only methods by which we can ever hope to reach truth and attain a proper stability and certainty in our determinations.",
            "There is another species of scepticism consequent to science and enquiry when men are supposed to have discovered either the absolute fallaciousness of their mental faculties or their untness to reach any xed determination in all those curious subjects of speculation about which they are commonly employed.",
            "I need not insist upon the more trite topics employed by the scep tics in all ages against the evidence of sense such as those which are derived from the imperfection and fallaciousness of our organs on num berless occasions the crooked appearance of an oar in water the various aspects of objects according to their dierent distances the double images which arise from the pressing one eye with many other appear ances of a like nature.",
            "These sceptical topics indeed are only sucient to prove that the senses alone are not implicitly to be depended on but that we must correct their evidence by reason and by considerations derived from the nature of the medium the distance of the object and the disposition of the organ in order to render them within their sphere the proper criteria of truth and falsehood.",
            "It seems evident that men are carried by a natural instinct or prepossession to repose faith in their senses and that without any reasoning or even almost before the use of reason we always suppose an external universe which depends not on our perception but would exist though we and every sensible creature were absent or annihilated.",
            "It seems also evident that when men follow this blind and pow erful instinct of nature they always suppose the very images presented by the senses to be the external objects and never entertain any sus picion that the one are nothing but representations of the other.",
            "But this universal and primary opinion of all men is soon destroyed by the slightest philosophy which teaches us that nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or perception and that the senses are only the inlets through which these images are conveyed without being able to produce any immediate intercourse between the mind and the object.",
            "These are the obvious dictates of reason and no man who reects ever doubted that the exis tences which we consider when we say this house and that tree are nothing but perceptions in the mind and eeting copies or represen tations of other existences which remain uniform and independent.",
            "By what argument can it be proved that the perceptions of the mind must be caused by external objects entirely dierent from them though resembling them if that be possible and could not arise either from the energy of the mind itself or from the suggestion of some 111 152 153 Section XII 112 invisible and unknown spirit or from some other cause still more unknown to us It is acknowledged that in fact many of these percep tions arise not from any thing external as in dreams madness and other diseases.",
            "Do you disclaim this principle in order to embrace a more rational opinion that the perceptions are only representations of some thing external You here depart from your natural propensities and more obvious sentiments and yet are not able to satisfy your reason which can never nd any convincing argument from experience to prove that the perceptions are connected with any external objects.",
            "The idea of extension is entirely acquired from the senses of sight and feeling and if all the qualities perceived by the senses be in the mind not in the object the same conclusion must reach the idea of extension which is wholly dependent on the sensible ideas or the ideas of secondary qualities.",
            "Thus the rst philosophical objection to the evidence of sense or to the opinion of external existence consists in this that such an opinion if rested on natural instinct is contrary to reason and if referred to reason is contrary to natural instinct and at the same time carries no rational evidence with it to convince an impartial enquirer.",
            "Bereave matter of all its intelligible qualities both primary and secondary you in a manner annihilate it and leave only a certain unknown inexplicable something as the cause of our perceptions a notion so imperfect that no sceptic will think it worth while to contend against it.",

            "No priestly dogmas invented on purpose to tame and subdue the rebellious reason of mankind ever shocked common sense more than the doctrine of the innite divisibility of extension with its consequences as they are pompously displayed by all geometricians and metaphysi cians with a kind of triumph and exultation.",
            "A real quantity innitely less than any nite quantity containing quantities innitely less than itself and so on in innitum this is an edice so bold and prodigious that it is too weighty for any pretended demonstration to support because it shocks the clearest and most natural principles of huma.",
            "Nothing can be more convincing and satisfactory than all the conclusions concerning the properties of circles and triangles and yet when these are once received how can we deny that the angle of contact between a circle and its tangent is innitely less than any rectilineal angle that as you may encrease the diameter of the circle in innitum this angle of contact becomes still less even in innitum and that the angle of contact between other curves and their tangents may be innitely less than those between any circle and its tangent and so on in innitum The demonstration of these principles seems as unexceptionable as that which proves the three angles of a triangle to be equal to two right ones though the latter opinion be natural and easy and the former big with contradiction and absurdity.",

            "Here he seems to have ample matter of triumph while he justly insists that all our evidence for any matter of fact which lies beyond the testimony of sense or memory is derived entirely from the relation of cause and eect that we have no other idea of this relation than that of two objects which have been frequently conjoined together that we have no argument to convince us that objects which have in our experience been frequently con joined will likewise in other instances be conjoined in the same manner and that nothing leads us to this inference but custom or a certain instinct of our nature which it is indeed dicult to resist but which like other instincts may be fallacious and deceitful.",
            "And though a Pyrrhonian may throw himself or others into a momentary 116 160 amazement and confusion by his profound reasonings the rst and most trivial event in life will put to ight all his doubts and scruples and leave him the same in every point of action and speculation with the philosophers of every other sect or with those who never concerned themselves in any philosophical researches.",
            "When he awakes from his dream he will be the rst to join in the laugh against himself and to confess that all his objections are mere amusement and can have no other tendency than to show the whimsical condition of mankind who must act and reason and believe though they are not able by their most diligent enquiry to satisfy themselves concerning the foundation of these operations or to remove the objections which may be raised against them.",

            "But could such dogmatical reasoners become sensible of the strange inrmities of human understanding even in its most perfect state and when most accurate and cautious in its determinations such a reection would naturally inspire them with more modesty and reserve and diminish their fond opinion of themselves and their prejudice against antagonists.",

            "While we cannot give a satisfactory reason why we believe after a thousand experiments that a stone will fall or re burn can we ever satisfy ourselves concerning any determination which we may form with regard to the origin of worlds and the situation of nature from and to eternity This narrow limitation indeed of our enquiries is in every respect so reasonable that it suces to make the slightest examination into the natural powers of the human mind and to compare them with their objects in order to recommend it to us.",
            "It is the same case with all those pretended syllogistical reasonings which may be found in every other branch of learning except the sci ences of quantity and number and these may safely I think be pro nounced the only proper objects of knowledge and demonstration.",

            "Thus for instance the limitations and restraints of civil government and a legal constitution may be defended either from reason which reecting on the great frailty and corruption of human nature teaches that no man can safely be trusted with unlimited authority or from experience and history which inform us of the enormous abuses that ambition in every age and coun try has been found to make of so imprudent a condence.",
            "Though it be allowed that reason may form very plausible conjectures with regard to the consequences of such a particular conduct in such particular circumstances it is still supposed imperfect without the assistance of experience which is alone able to give stability and certainty to the maxims derived from study and reection.",

            "The only dierence between them and those maxims which are vulgarly esteemed the result of pure experience is that the former cannot be established without some process of thought and some reection on what we have observed in order to distinguish its circumstances and trace its consequences Whereas in the latter the experienced event is exactly and fully similar to that which we infer as the result of any particular situation.",

            "With regard to energies which are exerted without our annexing to them any idea of communicated motion we consider only the constant experienced con junction of the events and as we feel a customary connexion between the ideas we transfer that feeling to the objects as nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation which they occasion.",
            "The necessity of any action whether of matter or of mind is not properly speaking a quality in the agent but in any thinking or intelligent being who may consider the action and it consists chiey in the determination of his thoughts to infer the existence of that action from some preceding objects as liberty when opposed to necessity is nothing but the want of that determination and a certain looseness or indierence which we feel in passing or not passing from the idea of one object to that of any succeeding one.",
            "Now we may observe that though in reecting on human actions we seldom feel such a looseness or indierence but are commonly able to infer them with considerable certainty from their motives and from the dispositions of the agent yet it frequently happens that in performing the actions themselves we are sensible of something like it And as all resembling objects are readily taken for each other this has been employed as a demonstrative and even intuitive proof of human liberty.",
            "We feel that our actions are subject to our will on most occasions and imagine we feel that the will itself is subject to nothing because when by a denial of it we are provoked to try we feel that it moves easily every way and produces an image of itself or a Vellety as it is called in the schools even on that side on which it did not settle.",

            "And for what reason impose on himself such a violence This is a point in which it will be impossible for him ever to satisfy himself consistently with his sceptical principles So that upon the whole nothing could be more ridiculous than the principles of the ancient Pyrrhonians if in reality they endeavoured as is pretended to extend throughout the same scepticism which they had learned from the declamations of their schools and which they ought to have conned to them.",
            "In this view there appears a great resemblance between the sects of the Stoics and Pyrrhonians though perpetual antagonists and both of Dialogues concerning Natural Religion 153 132 133 them seem founded on this erroneous maxim That what a man can perform sometimes and in some dispositions he can perform always and in every disposition.",
            "When the mind by Stoical reections is elevated into a sublime enthusiasm of virtue and strongly smit with any Species of honour or public good the utmost bodily pain and suerance will not prevail over such a high sense of duty and tis possible perhaps by its means even to smile and exult in the midst of tortures.",
            "If this sometimes may be the case in fact and reality much more may a philosopher in his school or even in his closet work himself up to such an enthusiasm and support in imagination the acutest pain or most calamitous event which he can possibly conceive.",
            "But you may observe at the same time that though the mind cannot in Stoicism support the highest ights of philosophy yet even when it sinks lower it still retains somewhat of its former disposition and the eects of the Stoics reasoning will appear in his conduct in common life and through the whole tenor of his actions.",
            "In like manner if a man has accustomed himself to sceptical considerations on the uncertainty and narrow limits of reason he will not entirely forget them when he turns his reection on other subjects but in all his philosophical principles and reasoning I dare not say in his common conduct he will be found dierent from those who either never formed any opinions in the case or have entertained sentiments more favourable to human reason.",
            "To whatever length any one may push his speculative principles of scep ticism he must act I own and live and converse like other men and for this conduct he is not obliged to give any other reason than the absolute neces sity he lies under of so doing.",
            "He considers besides that every one even in common life is constrained to have more or less of this philos ophy that from our earliest infancy we make continual advances in forming more general principles of conduct and reasoning that the larger experience we acquire and the stronger reason we are endued with we always render our principles the more general and comprehensive and that what we call philosophy is nothing but a more regular and methodical operation of the same kind.",
            "But when we look beyond human aairs and the properties of the sur rounding bodies When we carry our speculations into the two eternities before and after the present state of things into the creation and formation of the universe the existence and properties of spirits the powers and oper ations of one universal spirit existing without beginning and without end omnipotent omniscient immutable innite and incomprehensible We must be far removed from the smallest tendency to scepticism not to be apprehensive that we have here got quite beyond the reach of our faculties.",
            "So long as we conne our speculations to trade or morals or politics or crit icism we make appeals every moment to common sense and experience which strengthen our philosophical conclusions and remove at least in part the suspicion which we so justly entertain with regard to every reason ing that is very subtile and rened.",
            "We know not how far we ought to trust our vulgar methods of reasoning in such a subject since even in common life and in that province which is peculiarly appropriated to them we cannot account for them and are entirely guided by a kind of instinct or necessity in employing them.",
            "All sceptics pretend that if reason be considered in an abstract view it furnishes invincible arguments against itself and that we could never retain any conviction or assurance on any subject were not the sceptical reason ings so rened and subtile that they are not able to counterpoise the more solid and more natural arguments derived from the senses and experience.",
            "Dialogues concerning Natural Religion 155 135 136 In reality would not a man be ridiculous who pretended to reject Newtons explication of the wonderful phenomenon of the rainbow because that explication gives a minute anatomy of the rays of light a subject forsooth too rened for human comprehension And what would you say to one who having nothing particular to object to the arguments of Copernicus and Galilaeo for the motion of the earth should withhold his assent on that general principle That these subjects were too magnicent and remote to be explained by the narrow and fallacious reason of mankind There is indeed a kind of brutish and ignorant scepticism as you well observed which gives the vulgar a general prejudice against what they do not easily understand and makes them reject every principle which requires elaborate reasoning to prove and establish it.",
            "This species of scepticism is fatal to knowledge not to religion since we nd that those who make greatest profession of it give often their assent not only to the great truths of Theism and natural theology but even to the most absurd tenets which a traditional superstition has recommended to them.",

            "Now according to this method of reasoning Demea it follows and is indeed tacitly allowed by Cleanthes himself that order arrangement or the adjustment of nal causes is not of itself any proof of design but only so far as it has been experienced to proceed from that principle.",
            "For aught we can know a priori matter may contain the source or spring of order originally within itself as well as mind does and there is no more diculty in conceiving that the several elements from an internal unknown cause may fall into the most exquisite arrangement than to conceive that their ideas in the great universal mind from a like internal unknown cause fall into that arrangement.",

            "But the most usual species of connexion among the dierent events which enter into any narrative composition is that of cause and eect while the historian traces the series of actions according to their natural order remounts to their secret springs and principles and delineates their most remote consequences.",
            "He chuses for his subject a certain portion of that great chain of events which compose the history of mankind Each link in this chain he endeavours to touch in his narration Sometimes unavoidable ignorance renders all his attempts fruitless Sometimes he supplies by conjecture what is wanting in knowledge And always he is sensible that the more unbroken the chain is which he presents to his reader the more perfect is his production.",

            "If it be not necessary as in the Iliad to inform us each time the hero buckles his shoes and ties his garters it will be requisite perhaps to enter into a greater detail than in the Henriade where the events are run over with such rapidity that we scarcely have leisure to become acquainted with the scene or action.",
            "Were a poet therefore to comprehend in his subject any great compass of time or series of events and trace up the death of Hector to its remote causes in the rape of Helen or the judgment of Paris he must draw out his poem to an immeasurable length in order to ll this large canvas with just painting and imagery.",
            "The readers imagination enamed with such a series of poetical descriptions and his passions agitated by a contin ual sympathy with the actors must ag long before the period of the narration and must sink into lassitude and disgust from the repeated violence of the same movements.",
            "It is evident that in a just composition all the aections excited by the dierent events described and represented add mutual force to each other and that while the heroes are all engaged in one common scene and each action is strongly connected with the whole the concern is continually awake and the passions make an easy transition from one object to another.",
            "But were the poet to make a total digression from his subject and introduce a new actor nowise connected with the personages the imagination feeling a breach in the transition would enter coldly into the new scene would kindle by slow degrees and in returning to the main subject of the poem would pass as it were upon foreign ground and have its concern to excite anew in order to take part with the principal actors.",
            "By this means the readers curiosity is immediately excited The events follow with rapidity and in a very close connexion And the concern is preserved alive and by means of the near relation of the objects continually increases from the beginning to the end of the narration.",
            "This breaks the course of the passions and prevents that commu nication of the several emotions by which one scene adds force to another and transfuses the pity and terror which it excites upon each succeeding scene till the whole produces that rapidity of movement which is peculiar to the theatre.",
            "How must it extinguish this warmth of aection to be entertained on a sudden with a new action and new personages no wise related to the former to nd so sensible a breach or vacuity in the course of the passions by means of this breach in the connexion of ideas and instead of carrying the sympathy of one scene into the following to be obliged every moment to excite a new concern and take part in a new scene of action To return to the comparison of history and epic poetry we may conclude from the foregoing reasonings that as a certain unity is requisite in all productions it cannot be wanting in history more than in any other that in history the connexion among the several events which unites them into one body is the relation of cause and eect the same which takes place in epic poetry and that in the latter composition this connexion is Textual Variants 181 only required to be closer and more sensible on account of the lively imag ination and strong passions which must be touched by the poet in his nar ration.",
            "As the dierence therefore between history and epic poetry consists only in the degrees of connexion which bind together those several events of which their subject is composed it will be dicult if not impossible by words to determine exactly the bounds which separate them from each other.",

            "But if we consider on the other hand that all these events the rebellion of the angels the creation of the world and the fall of man resemble each other in being miraculous and out of the common course of nature that they are supposed to be contiguous in time and that being detached from all other events and being the only original facts which revelation discovers they strike the eye at once and naturally recall each other to the thought or imagination If we consider all these circumstances I say we shall nd that these parts of the action have a sucient unity to make them be comprehended in one fable or narration.",
            "These loose hints I have thrown together in order to excite the curiosity of philosophers and beget a suspicion at least if not a full persuasion that this subject is very copious and that many operations of the human mind depend on the connexion or association of ideas which is here explained.",
            "Particularly the sympathy between the passions and imagination will perhaps appear remarkable while we observe that the aections excited by one object pass easily to another object connected with it but transfuse themselves with diculty or not at all along dierent objects which have no manner of connexion together.",

Everyone is conscious to himself that he thinks and when thinking is going on the mind is engaged with ideas that it contains. So its past doubt that men have in their minds various ideas such as are those expressed by the words whiteness hardness sweetness thinking mo tion man elephant army drunkenness and others. The rst question then is How does he acquire these ideas It is widely believed that men have ideas stamped upon their minds in their very rst being. My opposition to this in Book I will probably be received more favourably when I have shown where the understanding can get all its ideas froman account that I contend will be supported by everyones own observation and experience. Let us then suppose the mind to have no ideas in it to be like white paper with nothing written on it. How then does it come to be written on From where does it get that vast store which the busy and boundless imagination of man has painted on itall the materials of reason and knowledge To this I answer in one word from experience. Our understandings derive all the materials of thinking from observations that we make of external objects that can be perceived through the senses and of the internal operations of our minds which we perceive by looking in at ourselves.These two are the fountains of knowledge from which arise all the ideas we have or can naturally have. First our senses when applied to particular perceptible objects convey into the mind many distinct perceptions of things according to the different ways in which the objects affect them. Thats how we come by the ideas we have of yellow white heat cold soft hard bitter sweet and all so onthe socalled sensible qualities. When I say the senses convey these ideas into the mind I dont mean this strictly and literally because I dont mean to say that an idea actually travels across from the perceived object to the persons mind. Rather I mean that through the senses external objects convey into the mind something that produces there those perception. This great source of most of the ideas we have I call SENSATION. Secondly the other fountain from which experience provides ideas to the understanding is the perception of the operations of our own mind within us. This yields ideas that couldnt be had from external thingsones such as the ideas of perception thinking doubting believing reasoning knowing willing and all the different things that our minds do. Being conscious of these actions of the mind and observing them in ourselves our understandings get from them ideas that are as distinct as the ones we get from bodies affecting our senses. Every man has this source of ideas wholly within himself and though it is not sense because it has nothing to do with external objects it is still very like sense and might properly enough be called internal sense. But along with calling the other sensation I call this REFLECTION because the ideas it gives us can be had only by a mind reecting on its own operations within itself. By reection then in the rest of this work I mean the notice that the mind takes of what it is doing and how. I am here using operations in a broad sense to cover not only the actions of the mind on its ideas but also passive states that can arise from them such as is the satisfaction or uneasiness arising from any thought. So thats my thesis all our ideas take their beginnings from 18 Essay II John Locke i Ideas and their origin those two sourcesexternal material things as objects of sensation and the operations of our own minds as objects of reection. When we have taken a full survey of the ideas we get from these sources and of their various modes combinations and relations we shall nd they are our whole stock of ideas and that we have nothing in our minds that didnt come in one of these two ways. Locke then challenges the reader to Search into his understanding and see whether he has any ideas other than those of sensation and reection. If you look carefully at the state of a newborn child youll nd little reason to think that he is well stocked with ideas that are to be the matter of his future knowledge. He gets ideas gradually and though the ideas of obvious and familiar qualities imprint themselves before the memory begins to keep a record of when or how ideas of unusual qualities are different. Some of them come so late that most people can remember when they rst had them. And if we had reason to we could arrange for child to be brought up in such a way as to have very few ideas even ordinary ones until he had grown to manhood. In actuality children are born into the world surrounded by bodies that perpetually affect them so as to imprint on their minds a variety of ideas light and colours are busy everywhere as long as the eyes are open sounds and some tangible qualities engage the senses appropriate to them and force an entrance into the mind. But I think youll agree that if a child were kept in a place where he never saw any colour but black and white till he was a man he would have no ideas of scarlet or greenany more than a person has an idea of the taste of oysters or of pineapples if he has never actually tasted either. How many simple ideas a person has depends for ideas of sensation on what variety there is among the external objects that he perceives and for ideas of reection on how much he reects on the workings of his own mind. The focussed intensity of the reection is relevant because someone who contemplates the operations of his mind cant help having plain and clear ideas of them he wont have clear and distinct ideas of all the operations of his mind and everything that happens in them unless he turns his thoughts that way and considers them attentively any more than he can have ideas of all the details of a landscape painting or of the parts and motions of a clock if he doesnt look at it and focus his attention on all the parts of it. The picture or clock may be so placed that he encounters them every day but hell have only a confused idea of all the parts they are made up of until he applies himself with attention to consider each part separately. Thats why most children dont get ideas of the operations of their own minds until quite late and why some people never acquire any very clear or perfect ideas of most of their mental operations. Their mental operations are there all the time like oating visions but until the understanding turns inward upon itself reects on them and makes them the objects of its own thoughts they wont make deep enough impressions to leave in the persons mind clear distinct lasting ideas. Children enter the world surrounded by new things that constantly attract their senses beckoning to a mind that is eager to notice new things and apt to be delighted with the variety of changing objects. So the rst years are usually spent in looking outwards at the surroundings and so people grow up constantly attending to outward sensation reecting very little on what happens within them till they come to be of riper yearsand some not even then. 9 Essay II John Locke i Ideas and their origin 9. When does a man rst have any ideas That is the same as asking when does a man begin to perceive For having ideas and perception are the same thing. I know that some philosophers hold that the soul always thinks and that it has the actual perception of ideas in itself constantly as long as it exists. For them actual thinking is as inseparable from the soul as actual extension is from the body which implies that the question When do his ideas begin is equivalent to When does his soul begin. For on their view the soul and its ideas must begin to exist both at the same time. How does the souls beginning to exist relate to the rst rudiments of organizationor to the beginnings of lifein the body Before it or at the same time or later I leave that question to be disputed by those who have thought harder about it than I have. But I do have a view about how the souls beginning to exist relates to its rst having ideas or at least to the view that the two must occur together because a soul cant exist except when it has ideas. I confess that I have one of those dull souls that doesnt perceive itself always to contemplate ideas and I dont think its any more necessary for the soul always to think than for the body always to move. In my view the perception of ideas is to the soul as motion is to the bodynot something that is essential to it but something that it sometimes does. So even if thinking is an activity that is uniquely appropriate to the soul that doesnt require us to suppose that the soul is always thinking always in action. Perhaps that is a gift possessed by God who never slumbers nor sleeps but it isnt appropriate for any nite being or at least not to the soul of man. We know by experience that we sometimes think and from this we validly infer that there is in us somethingsome substancethat is able to think but whether that substance perpetually thinks or not is a question we must answer on the basis of what experience informs us. To say that experience is irrelevant because actual thinking is essential to the soul and thus conceptually inseparable from it is to assume the very thing that is in question. Such a claim needs to be supported by arguments unless the claim is a selfevident propositionand I dont think anyone will contend that The soul always thinks is selfevident. The section continues with mockery of people who purport to prove something by assuming it among the premises of their argument and with a reply to a critic who misunderstanding something in the rst edition of the Essay had accused Locke of thinking that when you are asleep your soul doesnt exist. I grant that the soul in a waking man is never without thought because thats what it is to be awake. But I suspect that in sleeping without dreaming the whole man is asleephis mind as well as his bodyso that in that state no thought is occurring. If the soul thinks in a sleeping man without being conscious of it I ask whether during such thinking the soul has any pleasure or pain or any ability to be happy or miserable I am sure the man does not any more than the bed he lies on has pleasure or pain. For to be happy or miserable without being conscious of it seems to me utterly inconsistent and impossible. If you say that the soul might be in any of those states while the body is sleeping and the unsleeping man have no consciousness of them I reply In that case Socrates asleep and Socrates awake are not the same person but two persons. Locke elaborates this in the remainder of section 11 and on through 12 relying on a view of his about personal identity that hell develop more clearly and at greater length in xxvii. 0 Essay II John Locke i Ideas and their origin 13. Thus I think every drowsy nod shakes the doctrine of those who teach that the soul is always thinking Anyway those who do at some time sleep without dreaming can never be convinced that their thoughts are for four hours busy without their knowing of it and if they are taken in the very act waked in the middle of those sleeping thoughts they can give no account of it. It will perhaps be said that the soul thinks even in the soundest sleep but the memory doesnt retain those thoughts. This is utterly implausible. . . . Who can imagine that most men for several hours every day of their lives think of something of which they could remember nothing at all even if they were asked in the middle of these thoughts Most men I think pass a great part of their sleep without dreaming. I knew a man who was bred a scholar and had a pretty good memory who told me that he had never dreamed in his life till he had a fever at the age of twentyve. Everyone will have acquaintances who pass most of their nights without dreaming. To think often and never to retain it so much as one moment is a very useless sort of thinking. The soul in such a state of thinking would be little better than a lookingglass which constantly receives a variety of images but retains none of them they disappear and vanish without leaving a trace the lookingglass is never the better for such images nor the soul for such thoughts. We might also ask why it should be that all sleeping thoughts are forgotten given that many waking ones are remembered. Here is a possible answer to that In a waking man the materials of the body are used in thinking and the memory of thoughts is retained by the impressions that are made on the brain and the traces left there after such thinking but in the thinking of the soul that isnt perceived in a sleeping man the soul thinks apart making no use of the organs of the body and so leaving no impressions on the body and consequently no memory of such thoughts. . . . .I answer that whatever ideas the mind can receive and contemplate without the help of the body it can alsoit is reasonable to thinkretain without the help of the body too. If not then the soul gets little advantage by thinking. If it has no memory of its own thoughts if it cant lay them up for its own use and be able to recall them at need if it cant reect on what is past and make use of its former experiences reasonings and contemplations then what does it think for Those who make the soul a thinking thing in this way dont make it much nobler than do those whom they condemn who claim it to be nothing but very nely ground matter. Words written on dust that the rst breath of wind wipes out or impressions made on a heap of atoms or bodily uids are every bit as useful and ennobling as the thoughts of a soul that perish in thinkingthoughts that once out of sight are gone for ever and leave no memory of themselves behind them. Nature never makes excellent things for trivial uses or for no use and its hardly to be conceived that our innitely wise creator should bring it about that something as admirable as the power of thinkingthe power of ours that comes nearest to the excellence of his own incomprehensible beingis so idly and uselessly employed at least a quarter of the time that it thinks constantly without remembering any of those thoughts without doing any good to itself or others or being any way useful to any other part of the creation. If you think about it I doubt if youll nd that the motion of dull and senseless matter is ever anywhere in the universe made so little use of and so wholly thrown away. 1 Essay II John Locke i Ideas and their origin In section 16 Locke writes of thoughts that we do sometimes have in our sleep and remember after waking pointing out that they are mostly extravagant and incoherent. He says that his present opponents faced with this evidence will have to say that the soul thinks better when employing the body that when thinking apart from the body. He evidently thinks that this is an intolerable conclusion. In sections 1722 Locke continues to urge the empirical implausibility of the thesis that the soul always thinks and the unreasonable dogmatism of those who insist on it as necessarily true whatever experience may say. Much of the content of these sections repeats things said earlier in the chapter. The discussion gradually moves over to Lockes thesis that the soul thinks only when it has ideas to think with and to his view about how ideas are acquired. And so the chapter circles back to where it was in section 9. When does a man begin to have any ideas I think the true answer is when he rst has some sensation. Since there appear not to be any ideas in the mind before the senses have conveyed any in I think that ideas in the un derstanding arise at the same time as sensation. Sensation is an impression or motion made in some part of the body that produces some perception in the understanding. It is about these impressions made on our senses by outward objects that the mind seems rst to employ itself in such op erations as we call perception remembering consideration reasoning etc. In time the mind comes to reect on its own dealing with the ideas acquired from sensation and thereby stores up a new set of ideas that I call ideas of reection. . . . The rst capacity of human intellect is that the mind is tted to receive the impressions made on it either through the senses by outward objects or by its own operations when it reects on them. This is the rst step a man makes towards the discovery of anything and the basis on which to build all the notions he will ever have naturally in this world. All those sublime thoughts that tower above the clouds and reach as high as heaven itself take off from here. . . . In the getting of ideas the understanding is merely passive. It has no control over whether it will have these beginningsthese materials so to speakof knowledge. For many of the objects of our senses shove their particular ideas into our minds whether we want them or not and the operations of our minds wont let us be without at least some obscure notions of them. No man can be wholly ignorant of what he does when he thinks. The understanding can no more refuse to have these simple ideas when they are offered to it or alter them once they have been imprinted or blot them out and make new ones itself than a mirror can refuse alter or obliterate the images or ideas that the objects placed in front of it produce on its surface. . . . 2 Essay II John Locke iii Ideas of one sense Chapter ii Simple ideas 1. To get a better grasp of what our knowledge is how it comes about and how far it reaches we must carefully attend to one fact about our ideas namely that some of them are simple and some complex. The qualities that affect our senses are intimately united and blended in the things themselves but it is obvious that the ideas they produce in the mind enter via the senses simple and unmixed. A single sense will often take in different ideas from one object at one timeas when a man sees motion and colour together or the hand feels softness and warmth in a single piece of waxand yet the simple ideas that are thus brought together in a single mind are as perfectly distinct as those that come in by different senses. The coldness and hardness a man feels in a piece of ice are as distinct ideas in the mind as the smell and whiteness of a lily or as the taste of sugar and smell of a rose. And nothing can be plainer to a man than the clear and distinct perception he has of those simple ideas each of which contains nothing but one uniform appearance or conception in the mind and is not distinguishable into different ideas. These simple ideas which are the materials of all our knowledge are suggested and supplied to the mind only by sensation and reection. Once the understanding has been stocked with these simple ideas it is able to repeat compare and unite them to an almost innite variety and so can make new complex ideas as it will. But noone however quick and clever can invent one new simple idea that wasnt taken in by one of those two ways. Nor can any force of the understanding destroy those that are there. Mans power over this little world of his own understanding is much like his power over the great world of visible things where he can only compound and divide the materials that he nds available to him and cant do anything towards making the least particle of new matter or destroying one atom of what already exists. . . . God could have made a creature with organs different from ours and more ways than our ve senses to give the understanding input from bodily things. But I dont think any of us could imagine any qualities through which bodies could come to our attention other than sounds tastes smells and visible and tangible qualities. Had mankind been made with only four senses the qualities that are now the objects of the fth sense would have been as far from our notice imagination and conception as now any belonging to a sixth seventh or eighth sense can possibly be. Actually I think that perhaps we do have six senses but I have been following the usual count which is ve it makes no difference to my present line of thought. Are there creatures in some other parts of this vast and stupendous universe who have more senses than we do Perhaps. If you consider the immensity of this structure and the great variety that is to be found in our little part of it you may be inclined to think that there are somewhere different intelligent beings whose capacities are as unknown to you as are the senses or understanding of a man to a worm shut up in one drawer of a desk. Such variety and excellence would be suitable to the wisdom and power of our maker. 3 Essay II John Locke iv Solidity Chapter iii Ideas of one sense 1. We shall get a better grasp of the ideas we receive from sensation if we classify them according to their different ways of getting into our minds. First some come into our minds by one sense only. Secondly others enter the mind by more senses than one. Thirdly yet others are had from reection only. Fourthly some are suggested to the mind by all the ways of sensation and reection. We shall consider them separately under these headings. First some ideas are admitted through only one sense which is specially adapted to receive them. Thus light and colours come in only by the eyes all kinds of noises sounds and tones only by the ears the various tastes and smells by the nose and palate. If these organs or the nerves that are the channels along which they communicate with the brain become disordered so that they dont perform their functions the associated ideas have no door through which to enter no other way to bring themselves into view and be perceived by the understanding. The main ones belonging to touch are heat and cold and solidity. Most of the others have to do with perceptible texture like smooth and rough or with more or less rm hanging together of the parts like hard and soft tough and brittle. I neednt enumerate all the simple ideas belonging to each sense. Indeed I cant do so because there are many more of them than we have names for. Kinds of smell are at least as numerous as kinds of bodies in the world and few of them have names. We use sweet and stinking for them but this amounts to little more than calling them pleasing or displeasing the smell of a rose differs greatly from that of a violet though both are sweet. SimilarlyLocke goes on to saywith tastes and with colours and sounds. In my account of simple ideas therefore I shall pick out only a fewmainly ones that are most important for my overall enquiry. I shall also discuss some that tend to be overlooked though they are very frequently ingredients in our complex ideas. I think this is the case with solidity which is my next topic. Chapter iv Solidity 1. We receive the idea of solidity by the sense of touch. It arises from our experience of a bodys resisting the entrance of any other body into the place it occupies. There is no idea that we receive more constantly from sensation than solidity. Whether moving or at rest we always feel something under us that supports us and stops us from sinking further 24 Essay II John Locke iv Solidity downwards and we have daily experience of how when holding a body between our two hands the body absolutely prevents the hands from touching one another. My name for the property whereby one body blocks two others from touching is solidity. Mathematicians use that term in a different sense but mine is close enough to ordinary usage to be acceptable. If you prefer to call the property impen etrability go ahead but I prefer solidity for two reasons. It is close to common speech. The term impenetrability seems to refer not to the property itself but to a consequence of it and a negative one at that whereas solidity means something positive and points to the property itself not a mere consequence of it. Solidity seems to be the idea that is most intimately connected with and essential to body. The senses notice it only in masses of matter that are big enough to cause a sensation in us but once the mind has acquired this idea from such large bodies it traces the idea further and considers it as well as shape in the minutest particle of matter that can exist. Not only can we not imagine matter without solidity but we cannot imagine solidity to exist anywhere except in matter. Solidity is the idea of body whereby we conceive body to ll space. The idea of lling of space is this we imagine a space taken up by a solid substance which we conceive it to possess in such a way that all other solid substances are excluded from it. . . . This resistance whereby a body keeps other bodies out of its space is so great that no force however great can overcome it. All the bodies in the world pressing a drop of water on all sides can never overcome its resistance until it is moved out of their way. This distinguishes our idea of solidity both from a pure space which is not capable of resistance or motion and from b the ordinary idea of hardness. I shall deal with a now and with b in the next section. My target in a is Descartes who held that whatever is extended is ma terial so that vacuumunderstood as something extended and immaterialis conceptually impossible. I shall discuss this at length in xiii merely sketching my case against it here. We can conceive two bodies at a distance as being able to meet and touch one another without touching or displacing any other solid thing. This I think gives us a clear idea of space without solidity. Can we not have the idea of one single body moving without any other immediately taking its place Clearly we can for the idea of motion in one body doesnt include the idea of motion in anotherany more than the idea of squareness in one body includes the idea of squareness in another Im not asking whether in the actual state of the world it is physically possible for one body to move while no others do answering this either way would be taking a side on the debate over whether there is a vacuum. All I am asking is whether we can have the idea of one body moving while no others do and I think everyone will answer that we can. If so then the place the body leaves gives us the idea of pure space without solidity into which any other body can enter without being resisted and without displacing anything. If it is the case that when the piston in a pump is pulled up other matter has to take its place that comes from the worlds being full not from the mere ideas of space and solidity. . . . The very fact that people argue about whether there actually is a vacuum shows that they have ideas of space without a body. In contrast to solidity. . . .hardness consists in a rm cohesion of the parts of a mass of matter that is large enough to be perceptible so that the whole thing doesnt easily change its shape. Indeed we call things hard or soft only in relation to the constitutions of our own bodies we usually 25 Essay II John Locke iv Solidity call a thing hard if it will cause us pain sooner than change its shape by the pressure of any part of our bodies and soft if an easy and unpainful touch by our bodies can make it change its shape. The difference between hard and soft has nothing to do with solidity the hardest stone isnt the least bit more solid than water. The at sides of two pieces of marble will more easily approach each other when there is only water between them than when there is a diamond between them but that is not because the parts of the diamond are more solid than those of water. Rather it is because the parts of the water being more easily separable from each other can easily slide out of the way as the pieces of marble approach. If they could be kept from moving aside in that way they wouldjust as much as the diamondfor ever stop these two pieces of marble. . . . If you think nothing but hard bodies can keep your hands from approaching one another try that out with the air enclosed in a football. Locke then describes an experiment conrming what he has been saying. This idea of solidity marks off the extension of body from the extension of space. The extension of body is just the cohesion or continuity of solid separable movable parts and the extension of space is the continuity of unsolid inseparable and immovable parts. Its also because bodies are solid that they can bang into one another resist one another and change their shapes. Many of us think we have clear and distinct ideas and that we can think of pure space without anything in it that resists or is pushed around by body. The idea of the distance between the opposite parts of a concave surface is just as clear without as with the idea of solid parts between. And we also think we have an idea of something that lls space and can bump other bodies around or be bumped by them. If there are others who dont have these two ideas distinct from one another but think they are just one idea I dont know how to talk with them because they and I have the same idea under different names or different ideas under the same name. . . . If anyone asks me what solidity is I send him to his senses to be informed. Let him put a int or a football between his hands and then try to make the palms meet and hell know. If he isnt satised with this explanation of what solidity is I promise to tell him what it is when he tells me what thinking is or explains to me what extension or motion isa seemingly easier task. The simple ideas we have are such as experience teaches to us. If we try to go further than that and to make them clearer in our minds by giving verbal denitions we shall have no more success than we would if we tried to tell a blind man what light and colours are talking him into having ideas of them. I shall explain why this is so later on. 6 Essay II John Locke vii Ideas of sensation and reection Chapter v Simple ideas of different senses The ideas we get by more than one sense are of space or extension shape rest and motion for these are perceivable by sight and touch. And we can receive and convey into our minds the ideas of bodies extension shape motion and rest both by seeing and feeling. I shall have more to say about these later. Chapter vi Simple ideas of reection 1. After receiving ideas from outside the mind looks in upon itself and observes its own dealings with the ideas it already has and that gives it further ideas that are as t to have a role in its thinking as any of those it received from outward things. The main things the mind does encountered so often that everyone who wants to can nd them in himself are perception or thinking and volition or willing. The power of thinking is called the understanding and the power of volition is called the will and these two powers or abilities in the mind are called faculties. I shall later discuss some of the modes of these simple ideas of reection such as remembrance discerning reasoning judging knowledge faith. Chapter vii Simple ideas of both sensation and reection 1. Some other simple ideas convey themselves into the mind by all the ways of sensation and reectionnamely pleasure or delight and its opposite pain or uneasiness power existence unity. Nearly every other idea whether of sensation or reection is accompanied by either delight or uneasiness. And almost any state of our senses caused from outside ourselves and any thought of our mind within can produce pleasure or pain in us. By the terms pleasure and pain I signify whatever delights or displeases us whether it arises from the 27 Essay II John Locke vii Ideas of sensation and reection thoughts of our minds or anything operating on our bodies. For whether we call it satisfaction delight pleasure happiness etc. The innite wise author of our being has given us the power to move or not move certain parts of our bodies and through those movements to move other neighbouring bodies. And he has also given to our mind a power often to choose which of its ideas it will think of and which line of enquiry to pursue with consideration and attention. That is why heGodhas seen t to accompany various thoughts and various sensations with a perception of delight. If delight were wholly separated from all our outward sensations and inward thoughts we would have no reason to prefer one thought or action to another prefer negligence to attention or prefer movement to rest. And so we would neither stir our bodies nor employ our minds but let our thoughts drift along without direction or design. . . . A man in that state however equipped with understanding and will would be a very idle inactive creature and pass his time in a lazy lethargic dream. . . . Pain is as effective as pleasure in making us active be cause we will work as hard to avoid pain as to get pleasure. It is interesting to note that pain is often produced by the same objects and ideas as produce pleasure in us. . . . Heat is very agreeable to us in one degree but becomes extraordinarily painful when the temperature goes up a little. And the most pleasant of all perceptible things light itself causes a very painful sensation if its intensity is too great for our eyes. This shows the wisdom of our maker when any object acts so intensely on our sense organs that it threatens to damage their delicate structures pain warns us to withdraw before the organ is so damaged as to become useless. There is evidence that this is what pain is for. Although great light is insufferable to our eyes yet the highest degree of darkness does them no harm and isnt accompanied by pain. In contrast with that we are given pain by excess of cold as well as of heat because the two extremes are equally destructive to the bodily condition that is necessary for the preservation of life and the proper functioning of the body. It is the condition of having a moderate degree of warmthor if you will a motion of the imperceptible parts of our bodies that is not too fast and not too slow. Section 5 suggests another reason a theological one why God has scattered up and down various levels of pleasure and pain in all the things that surround and affect us. Section 6 gives a theological reason for discussing this. Existence and unity are two other ideas that are suggested to the understanding by every object outside us and every idea within. When ideas are in our minds we consider them as being actually there i.e. Power is another simple idea that we receive from sensation and reection. For we get the idea of power in two ways by observing in ourselves that we can at pleasure move various parts of our bodies that were at rest and by our constantly observing through our senses the effects that natural bodies can have on one another. Another idea that is suggested by our senses but is more constantly offered to us by what happens in our minds is 28 Essay II John Locke viii More about simple ideas the idea of succession. If we look into ourselves and reect on what we observe there well nd our ideas following one another with no interruptions throughout our waking hours. I think that these are allor anyway the most importantof the minds simple ideas out of which all its other knowledge is made. They are all received through sensation and reection. Dont think that sensation and reection are too narrow to supply all the materials of the capacious mind of man which takes its ight beyond the stars roaming beyond the world of matter out into incomprehensible empty space. It wont seem so strange to think that these few simple ideas sufce for the quickest thought or largest mental capacity if we consider how many words we can make by putting together various selections from twentyfour letters or if we consider how the mathematicians can get an inexhaustible and truly innite stock of material out of just one of the simple ideas I have mentioned namely number. In fact Locke hasnt mentioned it yet. It will be the topic of xvi. Chapter viii Some further points about our simple ideas 1. If something in nature can so affect the mind as to cause some perception in it that perception will present itself to the mind as a positive idea even if it is caused by a negative feature of the object. Thus the ideas of heat and cold light and darkness white and black motion and rest are equally clear and positive ideas in the mind though perhaps some of the causes pro ducing them are mere privations in the things from which our senses derive those ideas. Looking into those causes is an enquiry that belongs not to the idea as it is in the understanding but to the nature of the things existing outside us. These are two very different things and we should be careful to distinguish them. It is one thing to perceive and know the idea of white or black and quite another to examine what kind of surface texture is needed to make an object appear white or black. In section 3 Locke develops this point a little further. In section 4 he offers a suggestion about why a negative cause sometimes produces a positive idea. I wont try to settle here whether this suggestion is right. As for my point about the idea itself as distinct from its cause I appeal to everyones own experience the shadow of a man consists of nothing but the absence of light but doesnt it cause in an observer as clear and positive an idea as does the man whose shadow it is even though he is bathed in sunshine And the picture of a shadow is a positive thing. We do have negative names that stand directly not for positive ideas but for their absence. For example insipid silence nothing and their like denote positive ideas taste sound being together with a signication of their absence. So a person can be truly said to see darkness. . . . The causes I have here assigned for certain positive ideas are 29 Essay II John Locke viii More about simple ideas privative according to the common opinion and so I have called them but really it is hard to be sure whether there really are any ideas from a privative cause until we have settled whether rest is any more a privation than motion is. To reveal the nature of our ideas better and to talk about them intelligibly it will be convenient to distinguish them as they are ideas or perceptions in our minds and as they are states of matter in the bodies that cause such perceptions in us. That may save us from the belief which is perhaps the common opinion that the ideas are exactly the images and resemblances of something inherent in the object. That belief is quite wrong. Most ideas of sensation are in the mind no more like a thing existing outside us than the names that stand for them are like the ideas themselves. Whatever the mind perceives in itselfwhatever is the immediate object of perception thought or understandingI call an idea and the power to produce an idea in our mind I call a quality of the thing that has that power. Thus a snowball having the power to produce in us the ideas of white cold and round the powers to produce those ideas in us as they are in the snowball I call qualities and as they are sensations or perceptions in our understandings I call them ideas. If I sometimes speak of ideas as in the things themselves please understand me to mean to be talking about the qualities in the objects that produce them in us. Qualities thus considered in bodies are of two kinds. First there are those that are utterly inseparable from the body whatever state it is in. Qualities of this kind are the ones that a body doesnt lose however much it alters whatever force is used on it however nely it is divided. Take a grain of wheat divide it into two parts each part has still solidity extension shape and mobility divide it again and it still retains those qualities go on dividing it until the parts become imperceptible each part must still retain all those qualities. . . . I call them original or primary qualities of body which I think we may observe to produce simple ideas in us viz. Secondly there are qualities that are in the objects themselves really nothing but powers to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities i.e. Examples of these are colours sounds tastes and so on. I call these secondary qualities. To these we can add a third sort an example of which is the power of re to change the colour or consistency of wax and clay. This would ordinarily be said to be only a power in rather than a quality of the object but it is just as much a real quality as the powers that I have called secondary qualities. I call them qualities so as to comply with the common way of speaking and add secondary to mark them off from the rest. The primary qualities of rethat is the size texture and motion of its minute partsgive it a power to affect wax and clay etc. The next question is How do bodies produce ideas in us Obviously they do it by impact we cant conceive bodies to operate in any way but that. External objects are not united to our mind when they produce ideas in it and yet we do somehow perceive qualities in the objects. Clearly there has to be some motion that goes from the object to our senseorgans and from there is continued by our nerves or our animal spirits to the brains or the seat of sensa tion there to produce in our mind the particular ideas 30 Essay II John Locke viii More about simple ideas we have of them. Locke held the thencommon view that human physiology involves animal spirits. These constitute the bodys hydraulic system Bernard Williamss phrasean extremely nely divided uid that transmits pressures through tiny cracks and tunnels. Since the extension shape number and motion of visible bodies can be seen from a distance it is evident that some bodies that are too small to be seen individually must travel from those bodies across to the eyes and thereby convey to the brain some motion that produces in us these ideas that we have of them. We may conceive that the ideas of secondary qualities are also produced by the operation of insensible particles on our senses. Plainly there are plenty of bodies that are so small that we cant by any of our senses discover the size shape or motion of any one of them taken singly. The particles of the air and water are examples of this and there are others still smallerperhaps as much smaller than particles of air and water as the latter are smaller than peas or hailstones. Let us suppose in the meantime that the different motions and shapes sizes and number of such particles affecting our various senseorgans produce in us the different sensations that we have of the colours and smells of bodies. . . . It is no more impossible to conceive that God should attach such ideas to motions that in no way resemble them than it is that he should attach the idea of pain to the motion of a piece of steel dividing our esh which in no way resembles the pain. What I have said about colours and smells applies equally to tastes and sounds and other such sensible qualities. Whatever reality we mistakenly attribute to them they are really nothing in the objects themselves but powers to produce various sensations in us. These powers depend as I have said on those primary qualities namely size shape texture and motion of parts. From this we can easily infer that the ideas of the primary qualities of bodies resemble them and their patterns really do exist in the bodies themselves but the ideas produced in us by secondary qualities dont resemble them at all. There is nothing like our ideas of secondary qualities existing in the bodies themselves. All they are in the bodies is a power to produce those sensations in us. What is sweet blue or warm in idea is nothing but the particular size shape and motion of the imperceptible parts in the bodies that we call sweet blue or warm. Flame is called hot and light snow white and cold and manna white and sweetall from the ideas they produce in us. We know that Locke sometimes calls qualities ideas but that seems not to be enough to explain the oddity of the next sentence down to its rst comma. The passage as given here is almost verbatim Locke all of the oddity is there in what he wrote. Those qualities are commonly thought to be the same in those bodies as those ideas are in us the one perfectly resembling the other and most people would think it weird to deny this. But think about this a re at one distance produces in us the sensation of warmth and when we come closer it produces in us the very different sensation of pain what reason can you give for saying that the idea of warmth that was produced in you by the re is actually in the re without also saying that the idea of pain that the same re produced in you in the same way is in the re Why are whiteness and coldness in snow and pain not when it produces each idea in us and can do so only through the size shape number and motion of its solid parts 17. The particular size number shape and motion of the parts of re or snow are really in them whether or not anyones senses perceive them. So they may be called real 31 Essay II John Locke viii More about simple ideas qualities because they really exist in those bodies but light heat whiteness or coldness are no more really in them than sickness or pain is in manna. Take away the sensation of them let the eyes not see light or colours or the ears hear sounds let the palate not taste or the nose smell and all colours tastes odours and sounds vanish and cease and are reduced to their causes i.e. A big enough piece of manna can produce in us the idea of a round or square shape and by being moved the idea of motion. This idea of motion represents motion as it really is in the moving manna a circle or square is the same in idea as in existencethe same in the mind as in the mannaand this motion and shape really are in the manna whether or not we notice them. Everybody agrees with this. On the other hand manna by virtue of the size shape and motion of its parts has a power to produce in us the sensations of sickness and sometimes of acute pains. And everyone agrees also that these ideas of sickness and pain are not in the manna are only effects of its operations on us and are nowhere when we dont feel them. Yet it is hard to get people to agree that sweetness and whiteness arent really in manna either and are also merely the effects of the operations of manna by the motion size and shape of its particles on the eyes and palate. . . . It would be hard for them to explain why the ideas produced by the eyes and palate should be thought to be really in the manna while those produced by the stomach and guts are not or why the pain and sickness caused by the manna should be thought to be nowhere when they arent felt while the sweetness and whiteness of it should be thought to exist in the manna even when they arent seen or tasted. Consider the red and white colours in porphyry. Prevent light from reaching the stone and its colours vanish it no longer produces any such ideas in us when light returns it produces these appearances in us again. Can anyone think that any real alterations are made in the porphyry by the presence or absence of light and that those ideas of whiteness and redness are really in porphyry in the light when it obviously has no colour in the dark The porphyry has at every time a conguration of particles that is apt to produce in us the idea of redness when rays of light rebound from some parts of that hard stone and to produce the idea of whiteness when the rays rebound from some other parts but at no time are whiteness or redness in the stone. Pound an almond and the clear white colour will be altered into a dirty one and the sweet taste into an oily one. What real alteration can the beating of the pestle make in any body other than an alteration of the texture of it 21. We are now in a position to explain how it can happen that the same water at the same time produces the idea of cold by one hand and of heat by the other whereas the same water couldnt possibly be at once hot and cold if those ideas were really in it. If we imagine warmth in our hands to be nothing but a certain sort and degree of motion in the minute particles of our nerves or animal spirits we can understand how it is possible for the same water at the same time to produce the sensations of heat in one hand and of cold in the other which shape never does something never feels square to one hand and spherical to the other. If the sensation of heat and cold is nothing but the increase or lessening of the motion of the minute parts of our bodies caused by the corpuscles of some other body we can easily understand that if motion is greater in one hand than in the other and the two hands come into contact with a body that 32 Essay II John Locke viii More about simple ideas is intermediate between them in temperature the particles in one hand will be slowed down while those of the other will speed up thus causing different sensations. In what I have been saying I have gone a little further than I intended into physical enquiries. That is into questions about the biologypsychology of ideas questions about what actually happens in the world when ideas of a certain kind occur. But I had to throw a little light on the nature of sensation and to provide a rm grasp of how qualities in bodies differ from the ideas they produce in the mind for without this I couldnt write intelligibly about ideas. I hope I shall be pardoned this little detour into natural science. . . . So the qualities that are in bodies are of three sorts. First the size shape number position and motion or rest of their solid parts those are in them whether or not we perceive them and when they are big enough for us to perceive them they give us our idea of what kind of thing it isas clearly happens with artifacts. For example we recognize a clock or a coach from how its visible parts are assembled without need for guesswork about its submicroscopic features. I call these primary qualities. Secondly the power that a body has by reason of its imperceptible primary qualities to operate in a special way on any of our senses thereby producing in us the different ideas of various colours sounds smells tastes etc. These are usually called sensible qualities. I call them secondary qualities. Thirdly the power that a body has by virtue of the particular setup of its primary qualities to change the size shape texture or motion of another body so as to make the latter operate on our senses differently from how it did before. Thus the sun has a power to make wax white and re to make lead uid. These are usually called powers. The rst of these I repeat may be properly called real original or primary qualities because they are in the things themselves whether or not they are perceived. It is upon different modications of them that the secondary qualities depend. A modication of a quality is a special case of it a quality that involves it and more. Squareness is a modication of shapedness which is a modication of extendedness. The other two are only powers to act differently on other things which powers result from the different modications of those primary qualities. But though the two latter sorts of qualities are merely powers nothing else one of the two sorts are generally thought of as something else. The second sort namely the powers to produce ideas in us by our senses are looked on as real qualities in the things thus affecting us. The third sort are regarded as mere powers when we consider the sun in relation to wax that it melts or blanches we look on the waxs whiteness and softness not as qualities in the sun but as effects produced by powers in the sun. This correct understanding of the third sort of qualities is also right for the second sort. If rightly considered the qualities of light and warmth that are perceptions in me when I am warmed or lit up by the sun are no more in the sun than are the changes made in the wax when it is blanched or melted. . . . Section 25 is a fairly long and somewhat complex expla nation of why people are apt to think correctly about pow ers and incorrectly about secondary qualities. Section 26 winds up the chapter without adding anything except the suggestion that the second sort of qualities may be called secondary qualities immediately perceivable and the third sort secondary qualities mediately perceivable. 3 Essay II John Locke ix Perception Chapter ix Perception 1. Just as perception is the minds rst way of engaging with ideas the idea of it is the rst and simplest idea we have from reection. Some call it thinking but that is a misnomer because in correct English thinking stands only for operations on ideas in which the mind is active coming to bear on something with some degree of voluntary attention. In bare naked perception on the other hand the mind is mostly passive perceiving only what it cant avoid perceiving. What is perception youll know the answer to that better by reecting on what you do when you see hear feel etc. Whoever reects on what happens in his own mind cant miss it and if he doesnt reect all the words in the world cant make him have any notion of it. This much is certain whatever alterations occur in the body if they dont reach the mind there is no perception. Whatever impressions are made on the outward parts if they arent taken notice of within there is no perception. Fire may burn our bodies with no other effect than it makes on a piece of wood unless the motion is continued to the brain and there the sense of heat or idea of pain is produced in the mind. In that consists actual perception. Your own experience will tell you that quite often your mind while intently focussed on some things and on the ideas they involve takes no notice of the effects that other things are having on the organ of hearing although these effects are just like ones that ordinarily produce the idea of sound. There may be a sufcient impact on the organ but because it isnt observed by the mind no perception ensues. The motion that ordinarily produces the idea of sound is made in the ear yet no sound is heard. In this case the lack of sensation doesnt come from any defect in your organ of hearing or from your ears being less affected than at other times when you do hear. Rather it is that the physical effects arent taken notice of in the understanding and so they dont imprint any idea on the mind and so they cause no sensation. Whenever there is sense or perception some idea is actually produced and present in the understanding. So I am sure that children by the exercise of their senses on objects that affect them in the womb receive a few ideas before they are born. . . . If I may risk a guess on a matter that isnt very open to investigation I think the ideas of hunger and warmth are among themprobably among the rst that children have and hardly ever part with. But though we can reasonably suppose that children receive some ideas before they are born these simple ideas are nothing like the innate principles that I have rejected. The former come from states that the childs body is in or events that its body undergoes while it is in the womb which means that they depend on something exterior to the mind. In their way of being produced they differ from other sensebased ideas only in that they occur earlier. As against this innate principles are supposed to be of an entirely different sortnot coming into the mind through any particular events in the body but original characters stamped onto it from the outset. As there are some ideaslike the feelings of hunger and warmththat we can reasonably suppose to be introduced into the minds of children in the womb reecting the ne cessities of their life in that situation so the rst ideas that 34 Essay II John Locke ix Perception are imprinted on them after they are born are the sensible qualities that rst impinge on them. Light is a powerful example. Newly born children always turn their eyes in the direction from which the light comes which is some evidence of how greedy the mind is to get as many ideas as it can so long as they arent accompanied by pain. But childrens circumstances vary and so the order in which they acquire ideas varies too and this isnt something we have much need to enquire into. Speaking of adults now the ideas we receive by sensation are often altered by judgment without our noticing it. When we see a round uniformly coloured globesay of gold or alabaster or polished coalit is certain that the idea it imprints on our mind is of a at circle variously shadowed with various degrees of light and brightness coming to our eyes. But we know how convex bodies customarily appear to us how the reections of light are altered by the shapes of bodies and so our judgment acquires a habit of immediately altering the appearances into their causes. Faced with some thing that is really a variety of shadow or colour it infers what the shape is takes that variety to be a mark of that shape and forms for itself the perception of a convex gure and a uniform colour although the idea we receive is only a plane variously coloured as is evident in painting. A propos of that I shall here insert a problem that was put to me by the learned and worthy Mr. Suppose a man born blind now adult who has learned how to distinguish by touch between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and about the same size so that he can tell when he handles them which is the cube and which the sphere. Now suppose the cube and sphere to be placed on a table and the blind man be made to see. Can he by his sight before touching them tell which is the globe which the cube To this Mr Molineux answers No. For though the man has obtained the experience of how a globe affects his sense of touch and how a cube does he still has no experience telling him that something that affects his touch thus must affect his sight so. I agree. . . . I leave this with you to prompt you to consider how much you owe to experience learning and acquired notions where you have thought you hadnt the least help from them I especially want to include this question here because Mr Molyneux tells me that when the rst edition of my book appeared he proposed this question to various very able men and found hardly any that gave what he thinks is the right answer until he convinced them of it by giving reasons. This mistake doesnt happen much I think with ideas other than those received by sight. Here is why it happens with them. Sight which is the most comprehensive of all our senses conveys to our minds the ideas of light and colours which we get only from that sense and it conveys also the very different ideas of space shape and motion the variations in which bring with them changes in the appearances of light and colours and so we become accustomed to judging one by the other. When this is done with things of which we have frequent experience it is performed so constantly and so quickly that we take an idea formed by our judgment to be a perception of our sensation so that the latter serves only to trigger the former and is hardly noticed in itself. Similarly a man who reads or hears with attention and understanding takes little notice of the letters or sounds attending only to the ideas that they rouse up in him. In section 10 Locke comments on our generally not noticing that we are making such a substitution. He explains it partly 35 Essay II John Locke x Retention as resulting from the speed with which the substitution is performed As the mind is thought to take up no space so its actions seem to require no time and from its habitualness. He compares it with our unawareness of blinking. The faculty of perception seems to me to be what distinguishes the animal kingdom from the inferior parts of nature that is from plants. A good many plants are capable of motion when other bodies are applied to them they briskly alter their shapes and motions which leads to their being called sensitive plants because their movements somewhat resemble those that an animal makes because of some sensation that it has. But in plants it is I suppose all bare mechanism produced in the same kind of way as. . . .water produces the shortening of a ropewhich is done without any sensation in the subject or any having or receiving of ideas. I believe that perception occurs to some extent in animals of every sort though it may be that in some animals the inlets that nature provides for receiving sensations are so few and the perception they are received with is so dark and dull that it falls far short of the sharpness and variety of sensation in other animals. Still it is sufcient for and wisely adapted to the state and condition of animals of that sort. So the wisdom and goodness of the Maker plainly appear in all the parts of this stupendous structure and at all the different levels of creatures in it. Judging by an oysters structure I think we can reason ably conclude that it doesnt have as many sensesor ones as keenas men and many other animals have and because of its immobility it wouldnt be better off if it did. What good would sight and hearing do to a creature that couldnt move itself towards benet or away from harm even if it could see them at a distance And wouldnt keenness of sensation be an inconvenience to an animal that must lie still where chance has once placed it and be washed over by whatever watercold or warm clean or foulthat happens to come its way 14. Still I cant help thinking that oysters have some small dull perception that distinguishes their state from perfect insensibility. Locke goes on to liken this conjectured state of an oyster to the state of an extremely old man who has lost most of his memories and is blind deaf and without a sense of smell. Because perception is the rst step towards knowledge and is the inlet through which all its materials come into the mind the following is the case. The fewer senses any man or other creature has the fewer and duller the impressions are that his senses make and the duller the faculties are that he brings to bear on them the more remote he is from having the sort of knowledge that is to be found in some men. But there are so many different levels of this even amongst men that we cant know for sure where a given species of animals stands in this respect much less where an individual animal stands. . . . 6 Essay II John Locke x Retention Chapter x Retention 1. The next faculty of the mind by which it moves closer towards knowledge is one that I call retentionthe minds ability to keep simple ideas it has received from sensation or reection. This is done in two ways. In the rst the idea is kept actually in view for some timethis is called contemplation. The second kind of retention is the power to revive again in our minds ideas that have come to us and then disappeared. This is memory which is the storehouse so to speak of our ideas. Because the narrow mind of man couldnt keep many ideas in view and under consideration at once it needed a repository in which to store ideas that it might want to use later on. But our ideas are nothing but actual perceptions in the mind and cease to be anything when they arent perceived so that this storing of ideas in the repository of the memory really means only that the mind has a power in many cases to revive perceptions that it has once had with attached to them the additional perception that it has had them before. It is in this sense that our ideas are said to be in our memories when they are actually nowhere. . . . Attention and repetition help in xing ideas in the memory but the ones that at rst make the deepest and most lasting impression are the most likely to be remembered. And they are those that are accompanied by pleasure or pain. The great business of the senses is to alert us to what hurts the body or brings advantage to it so nature has wisely brought it about that pain accompanies the reception of certain ideas. That does the work of thinking and reasoning in children and acts faster than thinking in adults and so it leads both young and old to avoid painful objects doing this with the speed that is necessary for their preservationand settling in the memory a caution for the future. In section 4 Locke discusses ideas that the mind doesnt retain in memorybecause the idea was too brief or weak or uninteresting or the memory itself is weak or the person wasnt paying attention or through the condition of the body or some other fault. The section concludes In all these cases ideas in the mind quickly fade and often vanish from the understanding altogether leaving no more signs of themselves than the shadows of clouds do in ying over elds of corn and the mind is as empty of them as if they had never been there. Thus many of the ideas that were produced very early in the minds of children. . . .if in the future course of their lives they arent repeated they are quite lost with not a glimpse of them remaining. This can be observed in those who had the bad luck to lose their sight when very young in whom the ideas of colours having been only slightly taken notice of and have quite worn out because they havent been repeated. . . . There seems to be a constant decay of all our ideas even of those that are most deeply embedded in the most retentive minds so that if they arent sometimes renewed by repeated exercise of the senses or reection on the kinds of objects that at rst produced them the print wears out and at last there remains nothing to be seen. . . . The pictures drawn in our minds are laid down in fading colours and if they arent sometimes refreshed they vanish and disappear. I shant here go into the question of how far the structure of our bodies and the constitution of our animal 37 Essay II John Locke x Retention spirits are concerned in this and whether the state of the brain makes the difference between good memories and bad so that in some people the memory retains the characters drawn on it like marble in others like sandstone and in others little better than sand. It may seem probable that the constitution of the body sometimes inuences how well the memory functions since we often nd that a disease can strip the mind of all its ideas and the ames of a fever can within a few days burn down to dust and confusion the images which had seemed to be as lasting as if engraved in marble. But concerning the ideas themselves as distinct from questions about the efcacy of memory it is easy to see that the ideas that x themselves best in the memory and remain clearest and longest in it are the ones that are oftenest refreshed by a frequent return of the objects or events that produce them. These include the ideas that are conveyed into the mind by more ways than one. And so it is that ideas that are of the original qualities of bodies namely solidity extension shape motion and rest and ideas of qualities that almost constantly affect our bodies such as heat and cold and ideas that are applicable to beings of all kind such as existence duration and number which come along with almost every object that affects our senses and every thought that occupies our mindsideas like these are seldom quite lost except by a mind that loses all its ideas. In this secondary perception so to call it this viewing again of ideas that are lodged in the memory the mind is often quite active for the appearance of those dormant pictures sometimes depends on the will. The mind often sets to work searching for some hidden idea and turns the eye of the soul so to speak upon it upon the soul and the ideas it contain. But sometimes ideas start up of their own accord in our minds and present themselves to the understanding and very often they are aroused and tumbled out of their dark cells into daylight by turbulent and tempestuous passions because our various states bring to our memory ideas that would otherwise have lain quiet and unnoticed. A further point should be noted concerning ideas that are lodged in the memory and later revived by the mind. It is that not only are they not new ideas but they are not taken to be new by the mind. On the contrary it takes notice of them as of a former impression and renews its acquaintance with them as with ideas it had known before. . . . In a thinking creature memory is second in importance only to perception. It matters so much that when it is lacking all our other faculties are largely useless. In our thoughts reasonings and knowledge we couldnt move beyond present objects if we didnt have the help of our memories. This help may be defective in either of two ways. First the memory cant nd the idea at all and to that extent produces perfect ignorance. For since we can know a thing only so far as we have the idea of it when that is gone we are in perfect ignorance about the thing in question. Secondly the memory moves slowly and doesnt retrieve the stored idea quickly enough to serve the present purpose. When this happens a lot that is stupidity and someone who through this defect in his memory doesnt have easy access to the ideas that really are preserved in his minddoesnt have them ready at hand when he needs themis hardly better off than he would be without them in his store for they give him no service. . . . It is the business of the memory to provide the mind with those dormant ideas that it needs at a given moment. Having them ready at hand on all occasions is what we call invention fancy and mental agility. 8 Essay II John Locke xi Discerning etc. In section 9 Locke writes about how men differ from one another in the strength of their memories citing Pascal who in his prime forgot nothing of what he had done read or thought at any time since he reached the years of reason. He also speculates that probably all men differ in this respect from angels. He continues Mr. Pascals memory still had the narrow limits within which human minds are conned here on earth having a great variety of ideas only in succession and not all at once. Different grades of angels may have broader views some of them being able to retain together and constantly set before them as in one picture all their past knowledge at once. This would be a great advantage to the knowledge of a thinking man so it may be one of the ways in which the knowledge of unembodied Spirits greatly surpasses ours. Various nonhuman animals seem to have to a great degree this capacity for laying up and retaining the ideas that are brought into the mind. To take one example out of several when birds learn tunes the attempts one can observe in them to get the notes right convinces me that they have perception and retain ideas in their memories and use them as patterns. It seems to me impossible that they should try to conform their voices to notes as they plainly do of which they had no ideas. Admittedly a sound might affect a birds behaviour in a purely mechanical manner without involving anything mental e.g. For example a sound might mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal spirits in the brains of those birds while the tune is actually playing and that motion might be continued on to the muscles of the wings so that the bird is mechanically driven away by certain noises because this tends to its preservation. But that mechanistic nonmental approach couldnt explain why a sound should mechanically cause a motion of the birds vocal organs that would reproduce the notes of a sound it had heard earlier for such imitation couldnt be conducive to the birds preservation. Locke adds another bit of supposed evidence that in learning a tune a bird relies on its memory. Chapter xi Discerning and other operations of the mind 1. Another faculty we may take notice of in our minds is that of discerning and distinguishing ideas from one another. It isnt enough to have a confused perception of some thing in generalthat is taking in nothing beyond the bare fact of its being a thing. If the mind didnt have different perceptions of different objects and their qualities it would be capable of very little knowledge even if the bodies affecting us were as busy as they actually are and the mind were continually employed in thinking. This capacity for distinguishing one thing from another is the source of the obvious and certain truth of various propositions including some very general ones that have been taken for innate truths. Innatists have been led to their view for want of any other explanation of why those propositions are universally accepted. I am 39 Essay II John Locke xi Discerning etc. The acceptance of those propositions depends on the minds ability to discern or distinguishits ability to perceive two ideas to be the same or to be different.. . . . I wont go into the question of how far failures in accurately discriminating ideas from one another comes from defects in the organs of sense or lack of sharpness nimbleness or focus in the understanding or the way some people are apt to blunder hastily to conclusions. I merely note that this is one of the operations that the mind can observe in itself when it looks inward. It is so important to other knowledge that to the extent that this faculty is dull or isnt rightly used for distinguishing one thing from another to that extent our notions are confused and our reason and judgment are disturbed or misled. Whereas having our ideas in the memory ready at hand is having mental agility having them unconfused and being able to tell one thing from another even when the difference is small is much of what makes up exactness of judgment and clearness of reason. From this we can perhaps give some reason for the well known fact that people with a great deal of wit and prompt memories dont always have the clearest judgment or deepest reason. Wit lies mostly in nimbly putting one idea together with another idea that it resembles or in some other way goes with thereby making up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the imagination whereas judgment lies quite on the other side carefully separating from one another ideas that differ from one another however slightly so as not to be misled by a similarity into mistaking one thing for another. Locke develops this contrast saying that the appreciation of wit does not require and indeed is inimical to examination by the severe rules of truth and good reason. The chief aid to our distinguishing well amongst our ideas is their being clear and determinate. When they are so we wont be led into confusion or mistake when as sometimes happens the senses convey ideas from the same object differently on different occasions and so seem to err. Sugar may taste sweet to a man when he is healthy and bitter when he is in a fever but the idea of bitter in his mind is as clear and as distinct from the idea of sweet as if he had tasted only gall. Comparing ideas with one with another in respect of extent degrees time place or any other details is another operation that the mind performs with its ideas. On it are based all the many ideas that fall under the heading relation. I shall return to them late. For Locke a comparison of one thing with another neednt be a likening of them often it is some other kind of considering them together. It isnt easy to determine how far nonhuman animals have this capacity for comparing. I imagine they dont have it any great degree for though they probably have various ideas that are distinct enough yet it seems to me to be the prerogative of human understanding when it has distinguished any pair of ideas well enough to perceive them to be perfectly different and therefore to be two to cast about and consider how and in what respects they can be comparedthat is how they can be related to one another. I think therefore that nonhuman animals compare their ideas only in coping with their physical environment. We are probably safe in conjecturing that they dont at all have the other power of comparingthe one that men have and that belongs to general ideas and is useful only in abstract reasonings. The next operation we can observe the mind performing with its ideas is composition in which the mind puts together 40 Essay II John Locke xi Discerning etc. Under the heading composition we may also include enlarging in which we put together several ideas of the same kind. Thus by adding several units together we make the idea of a dozen and putting together the repeated ideas of yards we make that of a mile. In composition also I suppose lower animals come far short of man. They do take in and retain together various combinations of simple ideas. The shape smell and voice of a man may make up his dogs complex idea of him or rather are so many distinct marks by which it recognizes him but I dont think that the dog puts these ideas together to make a complex idea. Even where we think a nonhuman animal has a complex idea perhaps it is only one simple idea that directs the animal in the knowledge of various things that it doesnt distinguish visually as much as we imagine it does. I have been credibly informed that a bitch will nurse play with and be fond of young foxes as much as of her puppies and in place of them if only you can get them just once to suckle from her long enough for her milk to go through them. When children have through repeated sensations got some ideas xed in their memories they gradually begin to learn the use of signs. And when they acquire the skill to apply their organs of speech to producing articulate sounds they begin to use words to signify their ideas to others. They borrow some of these verbal signs from others but they also make some of their own as we can observe from the new and unusual names children often give to things when they rst use language. So words are used to stand as outward marks of our internal ideas which are taken from particular things but if every particular idea that we take in had its own special name there would be no end to names. To prevent this the mind makes particular ideas received from particular things become general which it does by considering them as they are in the mindmental appearancesseparate from all other existences and from the circumstances of real existence such as time place and so on. This procedure is called abstraction. In it an idea taken from a particular thing becomes a general representative of all of the same kind and its name becomes a general name that is applicable to any existing thing that ts that abstract idea. Such precise naked appearances in the mind without considering how or from where or in company with what others it acquired them the understanding stores away for use as standards it will classify real things into sorts on the basis of their agreement with these patterns or standards. The abstract ideas have names commonly attached to them so that they also serve as patterns for applying words labels to the things that they enable us to sort. Thus you observe the same colour today in chalk or snow that you yesterday saw in milk your mind considers that appearance alone makes it a representative of all of that kind and gives it the name whiteness and by that sound you signify the same quality wherever it is imagined or met with. This is how universals whether ideas or words are made. It is doubtful that nonhuman animals compound their ideas much I am sure that they have no power of abstracting at all and that the having of general ideas is what sharply distinguishes humans from other animals and is an excellence of which the others are in no way capable. Obviously we see no traces in their behaviour of their using general signs to stand for universal ideas which gives us reason to think they cant abstract or make general ideas. 1 Essay II John Locke xi Discerning etc. Their having no use or knowledge of general words cant be explained as resulting from their lack of appropriate vocal organs for we nd that many of the lower animals can make such sounds and pronounce words distinctly enough but they never mean anything general by them. And conversely men who through some physical defect cant utter words still manage to express their universal ideas by signs that they use instead of general words and we see that nonhuman animals cant do that. I think we may take this to be what essentially differentiates men from other animals a difference that wholly separates them by what eventually comes to be a vast distance. It has often been thought that the crucial difference is that men alone can reason but that isnt right. For if lower animals have any ideas at all and arent bare machines as some think they are we cant deny that they have some reason. It seems to me as obvious that some of them sometimes reason as that they have sense but when they reason it is only with particular ideas just as they received them from their senses and not subjected to abstraction. . . . Sections 1213 discuss the relations between the mental capacities discussed in this chapter and different kinds of mental deciency in humans. The following passage in 13 will be referred to in xxxiii.4 a man who is very levelheaded and has a good mind most of the time may in one kind of context be as frantic as any in the madhouse. This can happen becauseeither through some sudden very strong impression or through his long xing his mind on thoughts of one kindincoherent ideas have been cemented together in his mind so powerfully as to remain united there. The difference between idiots and madmen seems to be this madmen put wrong ideas together and so make wrong propositions but argue and reason correctly from them but idiots make few if any propositions and reason hardly at all. The faculties and operations of the mind that I have described in this chapter are exercised on all the minds ideas of whatever kind but my examples have mainly involved simple ideas. I have gone from my account of simple ideas in chapters iiviii directly to my account in chapters ixxi of these faculties of the mind before coming to what I have to say about complex ideas. I have three reasons for taking the topics in that order. First some of these faculties are at rst employed prin cipally on simple ideas so in following my order we can follow nature in its ordinary method and thereby track and reveal the faculties in their rise progress and gradual improvements. Secondly simple ideas are usually much more clear precise and distinct than complex ones so by observing how the faculties of the mind operate on them we can better grasp how the mind abstracts names compares and employs its other operationsbetter that is than if we also brought in complex ideas with which we are much more liable to make mistakes. Thirdly these very operations of the mind relating to ideas received from sensations are themselves when reected on another set of ideassome of them simple ideas derived from that other source of our knowledge which I call reection which makes it appropriate to deal with them immediately after the simple ideas of sensation. As for compounding comparing abstracting etc. I have said very little about them because I shall have occasion to treat them at more length in other place. I have given a short and I think true account of the rst beginnings of human knowledge where the mind gets its 42 Essay II John Locke xii Complex ideas rst objects from and how it goes about storing those ideas out of which all the knowledge it is capable of is to be made. I must appeal to experience and observation to decide whether my account is right. The best way to reach truth is to examine things as they really are and not to steer by fancies that we have worked up for ourselves or have been taught by others to imagine. Reverting now to my thesis that ideas enter the mind only through sensation and reection This is the only way I can nd for ideas to be brought into the understanding. If other men are sure that they have innate ideas the rest of us cant deny them the privilege that they have over us namely of knowing what goes on in their own minds. I can only speak of what I nd in myself which ts the account I have given. If we examine the whole course of men in their various ages countries and educations what we shall nd seems to depend on the foundations that I have laid. I dont claim to teach only to enquire. So let me say it again external and internal sensation sensation and reection are the only routes I can nd for knowledge to enter the understanding. These alone as far as I can discover are the windows through which light is let into this dark room. The understanding strikes me as being like a closet that is wholly sealed against light with only some little openings left to let in external visible resemblances or ideas of things outside. If the pictures coming into such a dark room stayed there and lay in order so that they could be found again when needed it would very much resemble the understanding of a man as far as objects of sight and the ideas of them are concerned. Those are my guesses concerning the means by which the understanding comes to have and retain simple ideas and their modes along with some other operations on them. I now proceed to examine some of these simple ideas and their modes in more detail. Chapter xii Complex ideas 1. So far we have considered only ideas that the mind receives passively namely the simple ones that come to it from sensation and reection. The mind cant make any such simple idea for itself and cant have any idea that doesnt wholly consist of them. But while the mind is wholly passive in the reception of all its simple ideas it acts in various ways to construct other ideas out of its simple ones which are the materials and foundations of all the rest. The acts in which the mind exerts its power over its simple ideas are chiey these three 1 Combining several simple ideas into one compound one that is how all complex ideas are made. Bringing together two ideas whether simple or complex setting them side by side so as to see them both at once without uniting them into one this is how the mind gets all its ideas of relations. Separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence this is called abstraction and it is how all the minds general ideas are made. 3 Essay II John Locke xii Complex ideas This shows that the power a man has and his exercise of it are pretty much the same in the intellectual world as in the material one. In neither realm has he any power to make or destroy any raw materials all he can do is either to unite them together or set them side by side or wholly separate them. For example he cannot make or destroy rocks but he can assemble them to make a wall or dismantle a wall that has been made from them. I shall begin with uniting and shall come to the other two in due course. As simple ideas are observed to exist in various combina tions united together so the mind has a power to consider several of them united together as one idea not only in combinations that exist in external objects but also in ones the mind makes up. Ideas thus made up of several simple ones I call complex. Examples are the ideas of beauty gratitude a man an army the universe. These are all complex ideas made up of simple ones but the mind can if it wishes treat each of them by itself as one unied thing signied by one name. By being able to repeat and join together its ideas the mind has great power to vary and multiply the objects of its thoughts innitely beyond what sensation or reection provides it with. . . . The basic raw materials of all its compo sitions are simple ideas received from those two sourcesthe mind has no other way of getting anybut once it has acquired these simple ideas it can by its own power put together the ideas it has making new complex ones that it never received united in that way. Complex ideas however compounded and decompounded are innitely numerous and endlessly various. Still I think they can all be brought under three headings 1 Modes. First modes are complex ideas that dont contain within them the supposition of existing by themselves but are considered as dependences on or states of substances. Examples are the ideas signied by the words triangle gratitude murder etc. These words stand for depen dences on substances because if there is a triangle that is because something is triangular if gratitude occurs that is because someone is grateful if there is a murder that is because someone murders someone. Forgive me if I am here using the word mode in somewhat a different sense from its ordinary one. When presenting a view that involves notions different from any that people commonly have one must either invent new words or use old ones with somewhat new meanings and in the present case the latter is perhaps the more tolerable of the two procedures. Two sorts of modes deserve to be considered separately. Some are only variations or different combinations of the same simple idea not mixed in with any other. For example the ideas of dozen and score are nothing but the ideas of so many distinct units added together. I call these simple modes because they are contained within the bounds of one simple idea. It should be remembered that a simple mode is like all modes a complex idea. Others are made up of simple ideas of different kinds put together to make one complex one. Examples are beauty a certain composition of colour and gure causing delight to the beholder and theft the concealed change of the possession of something without its owners consent which obviously combines several ideas of different kinds. I call these mixed modes. Secondly the ideas of substances are combinations of simple ideas that are taken to represent distinct particular things existing by themselves. In such combinations the supposed or confused idea of substance such as it is is 44 Essay II John Locke xii Complex ideas always the rst and chief. Thus if to the idea of substance we join the simple idea of a certain dull whitish colour and ideas of certain degrees of weight hardness ductility and fusibility we have the idea of lead and a combination of the ideas of a certain shape with mobility thought and reasoning joined to substance makes the ordinary idea of a man. Ideas of substances also fall into two sorts ideas of single substances as they exist separately for example the idea of a man or of a sheep and ideas of several of those put together such as the idea of an army of men or of a ock of sheep. An idea of the latter collective kindan idea that is of several substances put togetheris as much one single idea as is the idea of a man. Thirdly the last sort of complex idea is the one we call relation which consists in considering and comparing one idea with another. I shall discuss these different kinds in their order taking simple modes in chapters xiixxi complex or mixed modes in xxii substances in xxiiixxiv and relations in xxvxxviii. In section 8 Locke makes some windup remarks about the intellectual riches that we can get by operating in the ways he has described on the simple ideas we get from our outer and inner senses. He remarks that hell illustrate this in his treatments of the ideas we have of space time and innity and a few others that seem the most remote from simple sensebased ideas. 5 Essay II John Locke Chapter xiii Simple modes of space Chapter xiii Simple modes starting with the simple modes of space 1. I have often mentioned simple ideas the materials of all our knowledge focussing on how they come into the mind. Now I shall discuss some of them with a different focus this time it will be on how they relate to ideas that are more compounded looking into the different modications of the same ideamodications that the mind either nds in real things or makes up on its own initiative. A modication of a quality is a special case of it so squareness is a modication of rectan gularity see viii.23 and by a natural extension of that usage the idea of squareness can be called a modication of the idea of rectangularity. Those modications of a single simple idea which I call simple modes are as perfectly different and distinct ideas in the mind as those that are utterly unalike or even contrary to one another. For the idea of two is as distinct from that of one as blueness is from heat or as either of those is from any number yet it is made up only of repetitions of the simple idea of a unit. Repetitions of this kind joined together make the distinct simple modes of a dozen a gross a million. Section 2 merely repeats the point Locke has made in v that we get the idea of space both by our sight and touch. Space considered in terms purely of length between any two things without considering anything else between them is called distance if considered in terms of length breadth and thickness I think it may be called capacity. The term extension is usually applied to it whatever manner it is considered in whether in terms of one or two or three dimensions. Each different distance is a different modication of space and each idea of any distance is a simple mode of this idea. . . . We have the power of repeating any idea we have of some distance and adding it to the rst idea as often as we like without being ever able to come to any stop. That lets us enlarge it as much as we like which gives us the idea of immensit. There is another modication of this idea which is nothing but the relation that the parts of a boundary have to one another. In perceptible bodies whose surfaces come within our reach this relation is revealed by the sense of touch and the eye learns about it from bodies and from expanses of colours whose boundaries are within its view. Observing how the boundaries terminate either in straight lines that meet at discernible angles or in crooked lines in which no angles can be perceived and considering these as they relate to one another in all parts of the boundaries of any body or space the mind has the idea that we call shape which presents it with innite variety. For besides the vast number of different shapes that really exist in coherent masses of matter the mind has the power to make perfectly inexhaustible additions to its stock of ideas by varying the idea of space and thereby making new compositions. It can multiply shapes ad innitum by repeating its own ideas and joining them as it pleases. Section 6 continues with the theme of our freedom to make ideas of any shapes we like whether encountered in reality or not and adds that we can also form ideas of lengths or distances that are as long or as short as we please. Another idea that belongs in here is the one we call place. Whereas in simple space we consider the relation of distance between any two bodies or points in our idea of place we consider the relation of distance between some thing and 46 Essay II John Locke Chapter xiii Simple modes of space any two or more points that are considered as staying at the same distance from one another and thus as staying at rest. When we nd a thing at the same distance now as it was yesterday from two or more points that havent changed their relative distance in the interim we say it has kept the same place whereas if it has perceptibly altered its distance from either of those points we say that it has changed its place. . . . The idea of a things place is relative in a manner I now explain. If we nd the chessmen on the same squares of the board that they were when we left them we say they are all in the same place or unmoved even if the board has been carried from one room into another. That is because we relate them only to the parts of the chessboard which stay at the same distance from one another. The board we also say is in the same place as before if it remains in the same part of the cabin even if the ship has been sailing on and the ship is said to be in the same place if it keeps the same distance from the parts of the neighbouring land even though the earth has rotated. So chessmen board and ship have each changed place in respect of more distant bodies that have kept the same distance from one another. . . . This modication of distance that we call place was made by us for our own use and we t it to our convenience. When men speak of the place of a thing they do it by reference to those adjacent things that best serve their present purpose ignoring other things that might be better determinants of place for another purpose. When we are playing chess it wouldnt suit our purpose to locate the pieces in relation to anything except the squares on the board but quite different standards apply when the chessmen are stored in a bag and someone asks Where is the black king and the right answer is In the captains cabin. Another example when someone asks in what place certain verses are he doesnt want an answer that names a town or a library or a shelf he wants an answer such as They are at about the middle of the ninth book of Virgils Aeneid which remains true however often the book has been moved. . . . Because our idea of place is merely that of a things relative position we can have no idea of the place of the universe though we can of any part of it. We have no idea of any xed distinct particular beings in reference to which we can imagine the universe to be related by distance. On the contrary beyond it there is only one uniform space or expansion in which the mind nds no variety no marks. To say that the world is somewhere means merely that it does exist. . . . Someone who could nd out and form a clear idea of the place of the universe would be able to tell usas in fact obviously nobody canwhether the universe moves or stands still in the undifferentiated emptiness of innite space. . . . Some philosophersled into this by Descartes maintain that body and extension are the same thing. One might think they have changed the meaning of one of the words but I doubt that because they have so severely condemned others for relying on uncertain meanings and on the deceitful obscurity of doubtful or meaningless words. Well then if they mean by body and extension the same as other people do namely body something that is solid and extended whose parts are separable and movable in different ways extension the space that lies between the extremities of those solid cohering parts and which is possessed by them then they are confounding two very different ideas with one another. Isnt it clear to us all that the idea of space is as 47 Essay II John Locke Chapter xiii Simple modes of space distinct from that of solidity as it is from the idea of scarlet colour Solidity cant exist without extension but neither can scarlet colour exist without extension this doesnt prevent the ideas from being distinct from one another. Many ideas require as necessary to their existence or conception other ideas ones that are entirely distinct from them. Motion cant be or be conceived without space but motion is not space. Equally distinct from one another I think are the ideas of space and solidity and therefore the ideas of space and of body. That follows because solidity is so inseparable an idea from body that the latter depends on the former for its lling of space its contact impact and communication of motion on impact. If we canas some Cartesians doinfer that mind is different from body from the premise that thinking doesnt include the idea of extension in it we should be able by parity of argument to conclude that space is not body because it doesnt include the idea of solidity in it. Here are three reasons why body and extension are two distinct ideas. First extension doesnt include solidity or resistance to the motion of body as body does. Secondly the parts of pure space are inseparable from one another so that the continuity cant be broken up either really or in thought. One couldnt possibly break up a region of space into two separated parts with two surfaces where there had been a continuity and the very thought of such a separation is impossible being inconsistent with the idea of pure space. I am not denying that one can consider a portion of spacesay a cubic foot of itwithout considering the rest but that is a partial consideration not a mental separation which is something different. . . . One may consider light in the sun without its heat or mobility in a body without its extension without thinking of their separationthat is without thinking of the sun as cold or of the body as unextended. . . . Thirdly the parts of pure space are immovable which follows from their being inseparable because motion is nothing but change of distance between any two things and this cant happen between parts that are inseparable. Thus the established idea of simple space distinguishes it plainly and sufciently from body since its parts are inseparable immovable and without resistance to the motion of body whereas none of these is true of body. If anyone asks me What is this space you speak of I will tell him when he tells me what his extension is. For to say as is usually done that being extended is having parts outside parts is to say only that extension is extension. I learn nothing about the nature of extension when I am told Being extended is having extended parts that are exterior to extended parts. Compare What is a bre is a thing made up of several bres. . . . Those who contend that space and body are the same challenge us with a dilemma that they learned from Descartes. Either space is something or it is nothing if we say it is nothing then they reply that in that case two bodies cannot be separated by it because if there is nothing between two bodies they must touch one another. But if instead we say that space is something they demand that we tell them whether it is body or mind. I answer their question with a question who told them that there could be nothing but solid beings that cant think and thinking beings that arent extended. . . . If someone asks as people usually do whether space with no body in it is substance or accident I 48 Essay II John Locke Chapter xiii Simple modes of space answer I dont know and I shant be ashamed to admit my ignorance until the challengers show me a clear distinct idea of substance. I shall stay with substance for the next three sections returning to space in section 21a. I do my best to avoid the fallacies that we tend to fall into when we take words for things. It doesnt help our ignorance when we pretend to have knowledge by making meaningless noises. Madeup names dont alter the nature of things and unless they stand for denite ideas they dont enable us to understand things either. Those who lay so much stress on the sound of the two syllables substance should ask themselves what is going on when they apply this word to the innite incomprehensible God to nite spirits and to body. Do they apply it in the same sense Does it stand for the same idea when each of those three sodifferent beings are called substances If it is does it follow that God spirits and body agreeing in the same common nature of substance differ only in having different modications of it comparably with how a tree and a pebble are alike in having the common nature of body and differ only in having different modications of it That would be very hard to swallow. If instead they say that they apply substance to God nite spirit and matter in three different meanings expressing three different ideas they ought to make known what those distinct ideas are or at least to give them three different names to prevent the confusion and errors that will naturally follow from the promiscuous use of such a suspect term. So far from its having three different meanings in ordinary usage substance scarcely has one that is clear and distinct. . . . The philosophers who rst rushed into the notion of accidents as a sort of real beings that needed something to inhere in were forced to nd out the word substance to support them. In this context an accident is a propertyinstance. Locke is accusing his opponents of some such thought as this In this ball that I hold in my hand there is sphericity rubberiness softness a certain smell and so on that is there are this balls instances of those general properties but there must also be something that has them something that they are properties of. That must be a substance. Consider the poor Indian philosopher who imagined that the earth also needed something to hold it up. If only he had thought of this word substance he wouldnt have needed to nd an elephant to support the world and a tortoise to support the elephant the word substance would have met his needs That would have been as good an answer to his question as it is to the question of our European philosophers who ask what supports a things accidents and answers that it is substance. We have in fact no idea of what substance is but only a confused obscure one of what it does namely it supports accidents. In section 20 Locke continues his attack on substance ending with this sarcastic jibe against the view that accidents must inhere in a substance If the Latin words inhaerentia and substantia were put into the plain English that trans lates themsticking on and underproppingit would be easier for us to see the very great clearness there is in the doctrine of substance and accidents and show how useful they are in deciding of questions in philosophy. Through a mistake in the original work this section and the next were both labelled 21. Returning now to our idea of space and to the wrongness of identifying it with our idea of body I think everyone will agree that there is not an innite extent of matter body in the universe. Well then if a man were placed by God at the edge of the world of bodies could he stretch his hand beyond his body If he could then he would put his arm where there had previously been space without 49 Essay II John Locke Chapter xiii Simple modes of space body and if he spread the ngers of his outstretched hand there would be space between them without body. If on the other hand he couldnt stretch out his hand that would have to be because of some external obstacle and then I ask whether that obstacle is substance or accident something or nothing When they the Cartesians have settled that they will be able to settle what it is that can be between two bodies at a distance and is not body itself and has no solidity. Anyway this line of thought about nothing If a body is put in motion and nothing hinders it as would be the case beyond the utmost bounds of all bodies it can continue to move is at least as good as this one If there is nothing between two bodies they must touch one another. Really the former is better than the latter for pure space between two bodies is sufcient to block the inference to their being in contact with one another whereas bare space in the way isnt sufcient to stop motion. In fact these men must either admit that they think body to be innite though they dont like saying this aloud or else afrm that space isnt body after all. A thoughtful person can no more have the thought of a boundary to space than he can think of a limit to time if anyones idea of eternity is innite so is his idea of immensity either time and space are both nite or they are both innite. Furthermore those who assert the impossibility of space existing without matter must not only make body in nite but must also deny that God has a power to annihilate a part of matter. Presumably noone will deny that God could put an end to all motion keeping all the bodies in the universe completely immobile for as long as he pleased. Well then if you allow that God could during such a period of universal rest annihilate the book you are now reading you must also admit the possibility of a vacuum for the space that was lled by the annihilated book would still exist and would be a space without body. For the surrounding bodies being perfectly still make a diamondhard wall through which no other body can possibly get in. Indeed the supposition of plenitudei.e. But plenitude is only an unsupported supposition which needs some better proof than a supposed matter of fact which experiment can never establish. And it cant be accepted on conceptual rather than matteroffact grounds for our own clear and distinct ideas plainly satisfy us that there is no necessary connection between space and solidity since we can conceive the one without the other. Locke then repeats a point from iv.3 anyone who joins in the debate over plenitude as a matteroffact issue thereby commits himself to having distinct ideas of space and of matter or body. Without thinking about the edge of the material world and without appeal to Gods omnipotence we get evidence for the existence of a vacuum from the motion of bodies that we see in our own neighbourhood. I defy anyone to divide a solid body so as to make it possible for the solid parts to move up and down freely every way within the bounds of that surface without leaving in it an empty space as big as the smallest part into which he has divided the body. Locke goes on to say with some eloquence that this reasoning applies at any sizelevel you care to choose. But my topic was the question whether the idea of space or extension is the same as the idea of body and to answer No to this it isnt necessary to prove the real existence of a 50 Essay II John Locke Chapter xiii Simple modes of space vacuum. All that is needed is that we have the idea of it and it is plain that men have thati.e. If they didnt have the idea of space without body they couldnt make a question about its existence. . . . In section 24 Locke offers a suggestion about why the Cartesians made their mistake. The better Cartesians that is he is rude about the others. By sight and by touch he says the extension of bodies is forced in on us all the time so it has come to dominate the thinking of the Cartesians seducing them into thinking that none of the other properties of bodies could exist in the world except as properties of extended things. He concludes If they had reected on their ideas of tastes and smells as much as on those of sight and touch they would have found that the former didnt include in them any idea of extension. Extension is just one affection of bodyone among othersand it is discoverable by our senses which are hardly acute enough to look into the pure essences of things. The Cartesian view remember is that extension is the whole essence of body. Section 25 presents a mild philosophical joke the sort of thinking the Cartesians seem to have done should lead one to conclude that unity is the essence of every thing because every thing is an instance of iti.e. In section 26 Locke repeats his main case against the Cartesian view. He also mentions but doesnt answer the question of whether space is only a relation resulting from the existence of other beings at a distance or whether instead it is a kind of container. He declines to take sides on that question. He ends by suggesting some terminology including this To avoid confusion it might be helpful if the word extension were applied only to matter or the distance between the boundaries of particular bodies and the term expansion were used for space in general with or without solid matter possessing it. . . . That last suggestion points to a more general issue that will loom large in Book III but which warrants one section here. Knowing precisely what our words stand for would I imagine quickly end this dispute and very many others. For I am inclined to think that when men come to examine their simple ideas they nd them generally to agree though in conversation they may confuse one another by using different names. I imagine that men who abstract their thoughts from the words in which they express them and examine well the ideas of their own minds cant differ much in their thinking however much they may puzzle one another with words which they use according to the ways of speaking of the various schools or sects they grew up in. Though amongst unthinking men who dont scrupulously and carefully examine their own ideas and dont peel them off from the words men use for them but rather confound them with words there is bound to be endless dispute wrangling and jargon especially if they are learned bookish men who are devoted to some sect and have learned to parrot its way of talking. But if any two thinking men really had different ideas I dont see how they could converse or argue one with another. Dont misunderstand me. The sort of ideas I am speaking of dont include every oating imagination in mens brains. It isnt easy for the mind to put off those confused notions and prejudices it has absorbed from custom carelessness. It requires trouble and concentration for the mind to examine its ideas far enough to resolve them into the clear and distinct simple ideas out of which they have been compounded and to see which of its simple ones have a necessary connection with which others. . . . 1 Essay II John Locke xiv Duration and its simple modes Chapter xiv Duration and its simple modes 1. There is another sort of distance or length the idea of which we get not from the permanent parts of space but from the eeting and perpetually perishing parts of succession. This we call duration its simple modes are the different lengths of it of which we have distinct ideashours days years etc. A great manSt. Augustinewhen asked by someone what time is answered When you dont ask me I know what it is which amounts to this The more I set myself to think about it the less I understand it. This might lead one to think that time which reveals all other things is itself not to be discovered. Duration time and eternity are plausibly thought to have something very abstruse in their nature. But if we trace these ideas right back to their origins in sensation and reection one of those will be able to make these ideas as clear and distinct to us as many others that are not thought to be so obscure. Among other things we shall nd that the idea of eternity itself is derived from the same origin as the rest of our ideas. To understand time and eternity correctly we should attend to the nature of our idea of duration and to how we came by it. Anyone who observes what happens in his own mind must realize that there is a sequence of ideas constantly following one another in his mind as long as he is awake. Reection on these appearances of various ideas one after another in our minds is what provides us with the idea of succession and the distance between any two parts of that sequence or between the appearance of any two ideas in our minds is what we call duration. For while we are thinking or while we receive successively various ideas in our minds we know that we exist and so we call the existence or the continuation of the existence of ourselves our duration. We also speak of the duration of other things that coexist with our thinking. We dont perceive duration except when we attend to the sequence of ideas that take their turns in our under standings which convinces me that our notion of succession and duration comes from reection. When Locke writes a phrase like a succession of ideas this text replaces succession by sequence. In phrases like our notion of succession the word succession is left alone. When the sequence of ideas ceases our perception of duration ceases with itas everyone nds from his own experience of sleeping for any period of time long or short. While he is sleeping and not thinking he has no perception at all and the duration of his sleep is quite lost to him there seems to him to be no temporal distance from the moment he stops thinking to the moment he starts again. I am sure that it would be just like that for a man awake if he could keep only one unvarying idea in his mind. We do in fact see that someone who xes his thoughts very intently on one thing not attending much to the sequence of ideas that pass in his mind lets slip out of his account a good part of that duration and thinks the time that has passed is shorter than it really is. Locke adds the point that even a sleeping man retains a sense of time passing if he dreams which he takes as conrmation of his view. Someone who has in this way acquired the notion or idea of duration can apply it to things that exist while he isnt thinking just as someone who has acquired the idea of extension from bodies through his sight or touch can apply 52 Essay II John Locke xiv Duration and its simple modes it to distances where no body is seen or felt. That enables a man to judge how much time has passed while he was asleep and not dreaming. Having observed the revolution of days and nights and found the length of their duration to appear regular and constant he can suppose that this revolution went on in the same way while he was sleeping as it did at other times and this will give him a measure of how long he slept. But if Adam and Eve when they were alone in the world instead of their ordinary nights sleep had passed a whole twentyfour hours in one continued sleep the duration of those twentyfour hours would have been irrecoverably lost to them. If you think that we get the notion of succession from sensation rather than reection then consider this the motion of external bodies produces an idea of succession in your mind only to the extent that it produces there a continued series of distinguishable ideas. A man becalmed at sea may look on the sun or the sea or his ship for a whole hour during which time two and perhaps three of those objects have moved but because he hasnt perceived their motion he doesnt get from them any sense of duration i.e. But if during this hour of quiet he has been thinking he will perceive the various ideas of his thoughts appearing one after another in his own mind and thereby nd succession where he could observe no motion. I think this is why very slow uniform motions are not perceived by us. In such a case the change of relative distance is so slow that it causes no new ideas in usor only ones that are widely separated in timeand so we dont have a constant series of new ideas following one another immediately in our minds and thus have no perception of motion. . . . On the other side things that move very swiftly are also not perceived to move. It is because they dont affect the senses distinctly with the distinguishable distances of their motion and so dont cause any sequence of ideas in the mind. When we see a thing moving around in a circle in less time than our ideas ordinarily succeed one another in our minds we dont perceive it to move and see it rather as a perfect unbroken circle of that matter or colour and not a part of a circle in motion. I conjecture you decide for yourself that while we are awake our ideas succeed one another in our minds at certain distances somewhat like the images inside a lantern that are turned around by the heat of a candle. Their appearance in sequence may be sometimes faster and sometimes slower but I guess that it doesnt vary much in a waking man. There seem to be limits to how quickly and to how slowly ideas can succeed one another in our minds. My reason for this odd conjecture is my observation that in the impressions made on any of our senses we can perceive succession only within limits. If the sequence of impressions is exceedingly fast the sense of succession is lost even in cases where it is obvious that there is a real succession. Suppose that a cannonbullet shoots across a room on its way ripping off someones leg it couldnt be clearer that it must successively strike the two sides of the room and that its damage to the victim must occur between those two events. And yet I dont think that anybody who felt the pain of such a shot and heard the blows against the two walls would perceive any succession in these events. A stretch of time like this in which we perceive no succession is what we call an instant. It is that which takes up the time of only one idea in our minds. This also happens when the motion is very slow not 53 Essay II John Locke xiv Duration and its simple modes providing the mind with a constant series of fresh sensory ideas as fast as the mind is capable of receiving them. In these cases other ideas of our own thoughts can insert themselves into our minds between the ideas offered to our senses by the slowly moving body. So the sense of motion is lost. Although the body really does move its changes of perceivable distance from some other bodies is slower than the rate at which ideas of our own mindsideas of reectionnaturally follow one another in sequence. The thing therefore seems to stand still as is evident in the hands of clocks and shadows of sundials and other constant but slow motions. . . . It seems to me then that the constant and regular succession of ideas in a waking man is the measure and standardso to speakof all other successions. The re mainder of this section repeats the content of sections 10 and 11. Locke will take up temporal measurement in section 17 and run with it to the end of the chapter. Someone may say If the ideas of our minds constantly change and shift in a continual succession it would be impossible for a man to think long about any one thing. If this means that a man cant have one single idea for a long time alone in his mind with no variation I agree that it isnt possible. The only reason I can give for this opinion is an appeal to experience and I invite you to try whether you can keep one unvaried single idea in your mind without any other for a considerable period of time. I cant give a deeper and more explanatory reason for my view because I lack the knowledge that this would require. I dont know how the ideas of our minds are made or what they are made of or what lights them up for us or how they come to make their appearances. In sections 1415 Locke predicts the difculties that will confront anyone who accepts his try it for yourself challenge. Section 16 repeats the thought of section 6 namely that the motions of bodies support our idea of succession only through the succession of ideas they cause in us. Once the mind has acquired the idea of duration the next thing it is natural for it to do is to get some measure of this common duration by which to judge its different lengths and think about the order in which various events occur. Without this much of our knowledge would be confused and much of history would be useless. When duration is considered as broken up into measured periods the proper name for it is time. To measure extension we need only to apply our standard or measure to the thing we are measuringfor example laying a tapemeasure along a length of cloth. But in measuring duration we cant do that because no two parts of a sequence can be laid alongside one another. And nothing can measure duration except duration just as nothing can measure extension except extension but we cant keep by us any standing unvarying measure of duration as we can of certain lengths of extension marked out in durable material things. All we are left with for a convenient measure of time is the dividing up of long periods into apparently equal portions these being measured by constantly repeated kinds of event. Portions of duration that arent thought of as distinguished and measured by such periods arent strictly speaking instances of time and we reect this in phrases like before all time and when time shall be no more. Sections 1920 make and defend the following point Al though in our civilisation we measure time by movements e.g. All the measuring of time requires is regular periodic events of some kind they need not be movements. Locke gives examples of other standards for the measurement of time. Without a regular motion such as the suns it may be demanded how could it ever be known that such periods were equal I answer that the equality of any other periodic events could be known in the same way that days were known or presumed to be equal at rstnamely through judging them in terms of the contemporaneous series of ideas that had passed in mens minds. Locke develops this point in a long discussion of which the following episodes are especially notable. We must carefully distinguish duration itself from the measures we make of it. Duration in itself is to be considered as going on in one constant equal uniform course but none of our bases for measuring it can be known to do so. . . . If anyone should ask us how we know that the two successive swings of a pendulum are equal it would be hard to satisfy him that they are infallibly so. . . . Since no two portions of a sequence can be brought together it is impossible ever certainly to know their equality. All we can do for a measure of time is to take such kinds of events as have continual successive appearances at seemingly equidistant periods. And of this seeming equality we have no measure except the sequence of our own ideas with some conrmation from other probable reasons to persuade us of their equality. In section 22 Locke criticises the view that time should be dened to be the measure of motion bringing against it the points made in sections 1920 and adding one further point namely that time has no more right to the label measure of motion than space has. In section 23 Locke contends that there is no necessity about any of the measures of duration that we happen to useminutes hours days etc. We could adopt any others that satised the requirement of regular periodical returns. Once the mind has acquired a measure of time such as the annual revolution of the sun it can apply that measure to durations in which that measure didnt exist.. . . . The idea of duration equal to an annual revolution of the sun is as easily applicable in our thoughts to duration where no sun or motion was as the idea of a foot or yard taken from bodies here can be applied in our thoughts to distances beyond the connes of the world where are no bodies at all. If it is objected that in my account of time I have illegitimately assumed that the world is neither eternal nor spatially innite I answer that my present purposes dont require me to argue that the world is nite in duration and extension. That it is so is at least as conceivable as that it isnt so I am as entitled to assume the niteness of the world as anyone is to suppose the contrary. As regards conceivability I am sure that anyone who tries it will easily conceive in his mind the beginning of motion and so may come to a stopa gonofurtherin his consideration of motion but he cant in the same way conceive a beginning of all duration. So also in his thoughts he can set limits to body but not to space. The utmost limits of space and duration are beyond the reach of thought as are also the utmost limits of numberand all for the same reason as we shall see later. The origin of our idea of time also gives us the idea of eternity. Here is how. Having acquired the idea of succession and duration in the manner I have described and having 55 Essay II John Locke xiv Duration and its simple modes from the revolutions of the sun acquired the ideas of certain lengths of duration we can in our thoughts add such lengths of duration to one another as often as we please and apply the results of that addition to durations past or future. We can continue to do so without bounds or limits proceeding ad innitum.This lets us apply the length of the suns annual motion to a duration before there was any sun or any motion which is no more difcult or absurd than to apply my notion of one hour based on the moving of a shadow on a sundial to the duration of the burning of a candle last night which is now absolutely separate from all actual motion. All this requires is the thought that if the sun had been shining on the dial at that time its shadow would have moved from one hourline to the next while the candles ame lasted. In sections 289 Locke develops the idea that we can have the thought of determinate periods of time before there were any events by which to measure it. The crux is this from 29 For measuring the duration of anything by time the thing need not be coexistent with any motion that we use for temporal measurement or indeed with any periodic revolution of a kind we could use for such measurement. All we need is to have the idea of the length of some regular periodical appearances an idea that we can in our minds apply to durations with which the motion or appearance never coexisted. 0. . . . .I can imagine that light existed three days before the sun existed and moved by having this thought The duration of light before the sun was created was of a length such that if the sun had been moving then as it does now it would have been equal to three of its daily revolutions. . . . .In this way I can have the thought of somethings being the case a minute an hour a day a year or a thousand years before there were any moving bodies or any other regular periodic events. For I need only to consider duration equal to one minute and then I can add one minute more and so on until I come to sixty and by the same way of adding minutes hours or years. . . .I can proceed ad innitum. That involves supposing a duration that exceeds as many such periods as I can count however long I go on and I think that is the notion we have of eternity. The inniteness of eternity involves the same idea as we have for the inniteness of number to which we can add for ever without end. And thus I think it is plain that we get our ideas of duration and our measures of it from the two fountains of all knowledge that I have spoken ofreection and sensation. Then Locke swiftly recapitulates the six main topics of this chapter idea of succession idea of duration measure of duration thought of determinate lengths of duration when no measure exists idea of eternity idea of time in general. 6 Essay II John Locke xv Duration and expansion Chapter xv Duration and expansion considered together 1. Though I have dwelt pretty long on the topics of space and duration I shall stay with them comparing them with one another. They are important and also in some ways abstruse and peculiar and we may be helped to get a clear understanding of them by considering them together. I shall use the term expansion for the most general and abstract notion of space because extension for some people involves some thought of extended bodies. . . . In both expansion and duration the mind has the common idea of continued lengths capable of greater or less quantities for we have as clear an idea of how an hour differs from a day as we have of how an inch differs from a foot. The mind having acquired the idea of the length of any part of expansion can repeat it as often as it wants moving out to the distance of the sun or of the remotest star. In moving out in this way the mind encounters nothing to stop its going on inside the material world or beyond it. We can easily in our thoughts come to the end of solid extension the outer edge of all body we can easily arrive at in our thought. But when the mind is there it nds nothing to hinder it from moving on into the endless expansion beyond of that it cant even conceive any end. Dont say Beyond the bounds of body there is nothing at all unless you are willing to conne God within the limits of matter. . . . Similarly with duration having acquired the idea of some length of duration the mind can double multiply and enlarge itbeyond the existence of all bodies and all the measures of time taken from the great bodies of the world and their motions. Yet everyone readily admits that although we rightly make duration boundless we cannot extend it beyond all being. We all agree that God lls eternity and returning for a moment to the last topic of section 2 it is hard to nd a reason for anyone to doubt that God likewise lls immensity. His innite being is certainly as boundless in one way as in the other and to say that where there is no body there is nothing at all is I think to give too much importance to matter. In section 4 Locke says that many people who are sure that time is innite hesitate to say the same about space and he suggests a reason. It is because we think of both time and spaceor more strictly duration and expansionas states or properties of some being some thing where duration is concerned the thing can be God but we dont think of God as extended and so where space is concerned we are apt to think that it stops where matter stops because beyond the edge of the material world there is no thing for space to be an attribute of. Here Locke interpolates some thoughts about a likeness between the Latin roots of the words for enduring and for hard. Then returning to his main thought in this section But be that as it may it is certain that anyone who pursues his own thoughts will nd that they sometimes launch out beyond the extent of body into the innity of space or expansion the idea of which is distinct and separate from body and all other things. Time in general is to duration as place is to expansion. Time and place are such portions of those boundless oceans of eternity and immensity as have been set out and dis tinguished from the rest as it were by landmarks. The remainder of this section elaborates that a little. 7 Essay II John Locke xv Duration and expansion 6. Time and place taken thus to stand for determinate distinguishable portions of those innite abysses of space and duration that are supposed to be marked off from the rest by known boundaries have each of them a double meaning. First time in general is commonly taken for that part of innite duration that is measured by and coexistent with the motions of the great bodies of the universe. In that sense time begins and ends when this sensible world begins and endssee iv.18. Place is also sometimes taken for that portion of innite space that is occupied by the material world and is thereby distinguished from the rest of expansion though this is better called extension than place. . . . Secondly sometimes time is used in a broader sense and is applied not only to parts of that innite duration that were really distinguished and measured out by periodical motions of bodies that we use as our measures of time but also to other portions of it that we suppose to be equal to certain lengths of measured timethus considering them as bounded and determined even if they were really not so. In this spirit we might say Angels were created years before the world was thereby marking out as much of that undifferentiated duration as we suppose would have allowed annual revolutions of the sun if it moved at its actual rate. Likewise we sometimes speak of place distance or volume in the great emptiness beyond the edge of the world when we pick out in thought an amount of it that could contain a body of any assigned dimensions such as a cubic foot or suppose a point in it at suchandsuch a distance from a given part of the material universe. Where and When are questions that can be asked about any nite existent and we always answer them in terms for Where of relations to some known parts of this perceptible world and for When of relations to certain periods marked out to us by the motions observable in it. Without some such xed parts or periods our nite minds would be lost in the boundless invariable oceans of duration and expansion. Locke then adds details to this comparison between expansion and duration space and time. Space and duration are greatly alike in another way namely that although they are rightly counted as simple ideas every distinct idea we have of either of them involves some composition because it is the very nature of each to consist of parts. Still they are entitled to count as simple ideas because their parts are all of the same kind involving no mixture of any other idea. If the mind could as with number reach the thought of a part of extension or duration that is too small to be divided that would be the indivisible unit or idea by repetition of which the mind would make its more enlarged ideas of extension and duration. But since the mind cant form an idea of any space without parts it instead makes use of common measures such as inches and feet and repeats them to get ideas of larger extents. And similarly with time. Locke continues with remarks about the obscure and confused ideas that we have of very large or very small amounts of space or time. The idea of ten million cubic miles isnt clear though its ten million component is so. He observes that we have a rough and ready idea of a minimum amount of time or of spacenamely the smallest amount of which we can form a clear and distinct idea. In section 10 Locke likens expansion to duration in this both have parts but it makes no sense to think of either of them as being taken apart. Here is a manifest difference between expansion and duration. The ideas of length that we have can be turned 58 Essay II John Locke xvi Number in every direction and so make shape and breadth and thickness whereas duration is like the length of one straight line extended ad innitum and not capable of multiplicity variation or shape. Duration is something of which all things while they exist equally partake. For this present moment is common to all things that are now in being and contains that present part of their existence. . . .and we may truly say that they all exist in the same moment of time. Whether angels and Spirits have any analogy to this in respect to expansion is beyond my comprehension. Our understandings and comprehensions are suited to our own survival and the purposes of our own lives but not to the reality and extent of all other things. So it is nearly as hard for us to conceive of any real being with a perfect negation of every kind of expansion as it is to have the idea of a real being with a perfect negation of every kind of duration. So we dont know and cant even think about what Spirits have to do with space or how they relate to one another in it. All that we know is that each body possesses its own portion of it according to the extent of its solid parts excluding all other bodies from that portion of space for as long as it is there. Durationand time which is a part of itis the idea we have of perishing distance of which no two parts exist together but follow each other in sequence and expansion is the idea of lasting distance all of whose parts exist together and are not capable of succession. By perishing distance Locke seems to mean the evershrinking temporal distance between the present time and some future event. Because our idea of duration is as it is we cant get our minds around the thought of a being that now exists tomorrow or that now has more than the present moment of duration. Yet we can conceive Gods eternal duration as being far different from ours and any other nite beings. Our knowledge and power dont range over all past and future things our thoughts are only of yesterday and we dont know what tomorrow will bring. We can never bring anything back once it is past and we cant make present what is yet to come. What I say here about us I say of all nite beings. Even ones that far exceed man in knowledge and power are still no more than the meanest creature in comparison with God. Something nite however great and grand it is stands in no proportion to what is innite. Because Gods innite duration is accompanied by innite knowledge and innite power he sees all things past and to come and they are no more distant from his knowledge than the present. And there is nothing that he cant make exist whenever he likes. For the existence of all things depends on his good pleasure so all things exist at every moment that he thinks t to have them exist. A nal remark expansion and duration contain each other every part of space is in every part of duration and every part of duration is in every part of expansion. In all the great variety of our thoughts this combination of two distinct ideas seems to have almost no equal. It may be worth thinking about further. Chapter xvi Number 59 Essay II John Locke xvi Number 1. Among all the ideas that we have none is suggested to the mind by more ways and none is more simple than the idea of unity or one. It hasnt a trace of variety or composition in it and every object that our senses are brought to bear on every idea in our understandings every thought of our minds brings this idea along with it. This makes it the most intimate to our thoughts and also the most universally applicable idea that we have. For number applies itself to men angels actions thoughts everything that exists or can be imagined. By repeating this idea in our minds and adding the repetitions together we come by the complex ideas of its modes. Here and in many later passages mode means what modi cation meant earlier e.g. Thus by adding one to one we have the complex idea of a couple by putting twelve units together we have the complex idea of a dozen and so on for any other number. The simple modes of number are the most distinct of all our ideas. Every least variationnamely of one unitmakes each combination as clearly different from its nearest neigh bour as it is from the most remote two is as distinct from one as from two hundred. . . . This is not so with other simple modes where it can be hard and perhaps impossible for us to distinguish between two nearby ideas even though they are really different. Who will undertake to nd a difference between the white of this paper and that of the next degree of whiteness to it Who can form distinct ideas of every difference in size however small 4. Demonstrations with numbers may not be more evident and exact than demonstrations with extension but they are more general in their use and more determinate in their Application. Or so I am inclined think because each mode of number is so clearly distinct from all others even close ones whereas with extension not every equality and excess is so easy to observe or measure. With number we have the idea of a unit but with extension our thoughts cant arrive at any determined smallness beyond which it cant go comparable with a unit. . . . Noone can specify an angle that is the next biggest to a right angle 5. By repeating the idea of a unit joining it to another unit we make one collective idea marked by the name two. If someone can do this and can carry the procedure further by adding one to each collective idea that he reaches and also gives a name to every number whose idea he comes to then he can count. . . . He can add one to one and so to two and so go on with his tally taking with him the distinct names belonging to every stage in the progression and so he is capable of all the ideas of numbers for which he has names. Perhaps not of ideas for which he doesnt have names because the various simple modes of numbers have no variety and cant differ from one another in any way except as more or less so that names or marks for each separate combination seem more necessary than with any other sort of ideas. For without such names or marks we can seldom make use of numbers in calculating especially in cases involving a great multitude of units. When such a multitude is assembled in thought without a name or mark to distinguish that precise collection it will hardly be kept from collapsing into a confused heap. I think this is why some Americans with whom I have spoken though otherwise quick and intelligent didnt have our ability to count to and had no distinct idea of that number though they could calculate very well up to 20. Their language was scanty being accommodated only 60 Essay II John Locke xvi Number to the few necessities of survival in a simple way of life that didnt involve either trade or mathematics so it contained no word to stand fo. When I spoke to them about those greater numbers they would show the hairs of their head to express a great multitude that they couldnt number. After giving another example Locke speaks of the possibility of our wanting to think about higher numbers than we usually do and thus needing names for them. He proposes that as well as million we adopt billion trillion quadrillion and so on up to nonillionand further if we need to. His billion is a million millions. In section 7 Locke discusses children who at a time when they have a great deal of intellectual capacity cant count or handle particular numbers in other ways and some adults who through the default of their memories have a lifelong inability to cope with higher numbers. He concludes To calculate correctly one must do two things 1 distinguish carefully two ideas that differ from one another only by one unit 2 retain in memory the names or marks of the several combinations from a unit up to that numbernot confusedly and at random but in the exact order in which the numbers follow one another. If one goes wrong in either of these the whole business of numbering will be disturbed the ideas necessary for distinct numeration wont be achieved and one will be left only with the confused idea of multitude. Number is what the mind makes use of in measuring things. The main things that are measurable are expansion and duration and our idea of innity even when applied to thosein the ideas of innite expansion and innite durationseems to be nothing but the innity of number. What else are our ideas of eternity and immensity but the repeated additions of certain ideas of imagined parts of duration and expansion with help from the innity of number in which we can come to no end of addition Regarding that last point Let a man collect into one sum as great a number as he pleases its size doesnt lessen even slightly his power of adding to it or bring him any nearer the end of the inexhaustible stock of number where there still remains as much to be added as if none were taken out. This additionor addibility if you wishof numbers which is so apparent to the mind is I think what gives us our clearest and most distinct idea of innity. More about that in the next chapter. 1 Essay II John Locke xvii Innity Chapter xvii Innity 1. If you want to know what kind of idea it is that we name innity you cant do better than to consider what the idea of innity is most immediately applied to by the mind and then how the mind comes to form this idea. Finite and innite seem to me to be viewed by the mind as modes of quantity and to be attributed primarily and initially only to things that have parts and can be augmented or diminished by the addition or subtraction of parts however small. Such are the ideas of space duration and number which we have considered in xiiixvi. No doubt we must accept that the great God is incomprehensibly innite but when we apply innite to that rst and supreme being we do it primarily in respect to when and where he exists in the judgment that he exists always and everywhere and we apply innity more guratively I think to his power wisdom and goodness and other attributes which are in their own natures inexhaustible and incomprehensible etc. When we call them innite we have no other idea of this innity except what carries with it some reection on and imitation of that number or extent of the acts or objects of Gods power wisdom and goodness. I make no claim about how these attributes are in God who is innitely beyond the reach of our narrow capacities. They certainly contain in them all possible perfection. But this I say is how we conceive them and these are our ideas of their innity. Finite and innite then are viewed by the mind as modications of expansion and duration. Next we must consider how the mind comes by these ideas. There is no great difculty about nite. The obvious portions of extension that affect our senses carry the idea of nite with them into the mind and the ordinary periods hours days years whereby we measure time and duration are bounded lengths and thus nite. What is difcult is to grasp how we come by those boundless ideas of eternity and immensity since the objects we interact with fall so far shortimmeasurably shortof that largeness. Someone who has an idea of some stated length of space nds that he can repeat it going from the idea of one foot say to that of two feet and that by further addition he can go to three feet and so on without ever reaching an end of his addition. This holds good whether he started with the idea of a foot or of a mile or of the diameter of the earth. Whatever he starts with and however often he multiplies it he nds that however far he has gone he has no more reason to stopand isnt one jot nearer the endthan he was when he set out. From this he takes the idea of innite space. That account of the source of the idea of innite space doesnt settle whether there actually exists a boundless space answering to the idea because our ideas arent always proofs of the existence of things. Still since the question of spaces innity has come up here I remark that we are apt to think that space is actually boundless the idea of space or expansion naturally draws us in that direction. Whether we consider it as the extension of body or as existing by itself without any solid matter occupying it the mind cant possibly nd or suppose any end of it or be stopped anywhere in its progress in this space. Any boundary to the world of bodieseven one with diamondhard wallsis so far from stopping the minds further progress in space and extension that it actually helps it to continue. When we reach the utmost extremity of body what do we nd that can put a 62 Essay II John Locke xvii Innity stop and satisfy the mind that it is at the end of space when it perceives that it is notwhen indeed it is satised that body itself can move into it into the space outside the present material boundary Here is why. A body can move through empty space within the world of bodies indeed it cant move anywhere except into empty space see xiii.22. It is clear and evident that if a body can move into an empty space interspersed amongst bodies it must be equally possible for it to move into empty space beyond the outer boundaries of the world of bodies. That is because idea of empty pure space is exactly the same within as beyond the limits of all bodies and there is nothing to hinder body from moving into it in either case. Thus wherever the mind places itself by any thought either in among bodies or far away from them it cant nd any end anywhere in this uniform idea of space and so it has to conclude by the very nature and idea of each part of space that space is actually innite. Section 5 gives a similar account of how we come by the idea of eternity or innite duration. The question of whether any real thing lasts for ever Locke says isnt answered merely by our having an idea of eternity. He holds that if something exists now then something has existed for eternity but he will discuss this in another place IV.x.23. If we get our idea of innity from our ability to repeat our own ideas without end you may wonder why we dont attribute innity to ideas other than those of space and duration. Other ideas can be as easily and as often re peated in our minds as can those of space and duration but nobody ever thinks of innite sweetness or innite whiteness although we can repeat the idea of sweet or white as frequently as those of a yard or a day. Here is my answer. All the ideas that are considered as having parts and can be increased by adding equal or lesser parts give us through their repetition the idea of innity because this endless repetition generates a continued enlargement that cannot come to an end. But with other ideas it is not so. Locke defends this by canvassing the possibilities for what goes on when one tries to add one idea of whiteness to another. The reason why they dont allow of endless additions he says is that the idea of whiteness involves degrees but not parts. He concludes Those ideas that dont consist of parts cant be augmented to whatever proportion men please or be stretched beyond what men have received by their senses but space duration and number being capable of increase by repetition leave in the mind an idea of endless room for more. The latter ideas alone lead our minds towards the thought of innity. Although our idea of innity arises from thoughts about quantity when we join innity to any supposed idea of quantity and so think about an innite quantityan innite space or an innite durationwe fall into great confusion. That is because our idea of innity is an endlessly growing idea while any idea the mind has of a quantity terminates in that very idea which cant be greater than itself so when we try to combine them in the thought of an innite quantity we have to adjust a standing measure to a growing volume. So I think there is serious reason to distinguish the idea of the innity of space from the idea of a space that is innite. The former is nothing but a supposed endless progression of the mind over whatever repeated ideas of space it pleases but to have actually in the mind the idea of a space that is innite is to suppose that the mind has already passed over and actually viewed all those repeated ideas of space. Even an endless repetition can never go through them all so to suppose that one has done so is a plain contradiction. 3 Essay II John Locke xvii Innity 8. This may become clearer if we apply it to numbers. Locke then presents a line of thought like that of section 7 leading to the conclusion that we have a clear and legitimate idea of the innity of numbers but that it is absurd to think that we can have an actual idea of an innite number. He applies this also to innite duration and repeats it for innite space. A typical episode is this However large an idea of space I have in my mind it is no larger than it is at this instant when I have it though I am capable of doubling it an instant later and so on ad innitum. In sections 911 Locke arguesamplifying a hint he gave in xvi.8that when we think about the innity of space or of duration what we are engaged with is the innity of number applied to determinate parts of which we have distinct ideas. Our thought of eternity is that of a duration that is innitely many years long our thought of immensity is that of a region whose volume is innitely many cubic yards. In any mass of matter our thoughts can never arrive at the ultimate division so there is an apparent innity to us in that also. It too involves the innity of number but with the difference that it is like division rather than addition. Still it does involve proceeding ad innitum with new numberssmaller and smaller fractionsall the way. A similarity just as we cant by addition reach the idea of an innitely great space so by division we are unable to reach the idea of an innitely small body because our idea of innity is so to speak a growing or fugitive idea always in a boundless progression stopping nowhere. Although hardly anyone is so absurd as to claim to have the positive idea of an actual innite number. . . .there are people who imagine they have positive ideas of innite duration and space. I think it would be enough to destroy any such purported positive idea of something innite to ask its owner whether he could add to it that would easily show his mistake. . . . An innite idea of space or duration must be made up of innite parts so the thought of its innity must consist in the thought of its having parts whose number can always be further added to it doesnt involve an actual positive idea of an innite number. It is evident that by adding together nite things and all the lengths of which we have positive ideas are nite we can never produce the idea of innite in any way except the way we do with number. . . .adding more and more units of the same kind without coming one jot nearer to the end of the process. Those who want to prove that their idea of innite is positive seem to do it through a ridiculous argument the idea of an end is negative so the idea of innitythe negation of an endis positive Someone who sees that where bodies are concerned an end is just the extremity or surface of the body will not readily grant that the end is a bare negative any more than will someone who sees that the end of his pen is black or white Where duration is concerned an end isnt the bare negation of existence but rather the last moment of it. Also the people I am arguing against here cant deny that the beginning is the rst instant of being and isnt conceived by anyone to be a bare negation so by their own argument they should admit that the idea of an eternal past or of a duration without a beginning is a negative one. In section 15 Locke develops these views further. He agrees that when we think of say the innity of space our thought does include a positive element namely the vague thought of a really enormously large stretch of space but he dis tinguishes that from a genuine thought about innity. His crucial triplepoint in this section is the following. The 64 Essay II John Locke xvii Innity idea of so much is positive and clear. The idea of greater is also clear but it is only a comparative idea. The idea of so much greater that it cannot be comprehended is a plain negative not a positive. What lies beyond our positive idea towards innity lies in obscurity and has the indeterminate confusion of a negative idea in which I know that I cant include all that I want to because that is too large for a nite and narrow mental capacity such as mine and thatwhere the greatest part of what I want to include is left out and merely given the vague label still greatermust be very far from a positive complete idea. . . . In section 16 Locke challenges those who think they have a positive idea of eternity. If there is or could be an eternally existing thing he demands has it lasted longer today than it had yesterday The answer Yes strikes him as absurd because it involves different eternities with different lengths. But the only way to support the answer No is to equate eternal duration with a kind of eternal present to which the idea of succession of longer and shorter durations doesnt apply. He aligns himself with those who nd this unintelligible. Section 17 repeats section 14s point that there is nothing negative about the concept of a beginning. We can no more have a positive idea of the largest space than we can of the smallest space. The latter seems the easier of the two and more within our intellectual reach but really all we can manage is a comparative idea of smallnessthe idea of a smallness that will always be less than any of which we have a positive idea. All our positive ideas of any quantity whether big or small have bounds though there are no bounds to the comparative idea through which we can always add to the big or take from the small. Locke has mostly been using positive as the opposite of negative but here and in some other places he uses it as the opposite of relational or comparative. But the part big or small that isnt covered by our positive idea lies in obscurity and we have no idea of it except the idea of the power of endlessly enlarging one and diminishing the other. The acutest thought of a mathematician can no more isolate the idea of an indivisible ultimate particle of matter than a chemist wielding a pestle and mortar can physically isolate such a particle. And a philosopher by the quickest ight of mind can no more reach a thought of innite space containing it within a positive idea than a surveyor can mark it out with his chain measure. When you think of a cube with a oneinch side you have a clear and positive idea of it in your mind and so can form one of and so on until you have the idea something very small. But it still isnt the idea of that incomprehensible smallness that division can produce. What remains of smallness is as far from your thoughts as it was when you rst began so you never come to have a clear and positive idea of that smallness that is implied by innite divisibility. Section 19 repeats the main point in a mildly joking man ner. I have encountered people who agree that they cannot have a positive idea of innite space but are sure they have one of eternity. Here is my explanation for their mistaken view that the two should be treated differently. By thinking about causes and effects they are led to think that we must admit some eternal being and so to consider the reality of that being as matched by their idea of eternity but on the other hand they have no argument driving them to admit the existence of some innite body which indeed they nd absurd and so they rush into concluding that they can 65 Essay II John Locke xvii Innity have no idea of innite space because they can have no idea of innite matter. The argument about causes and effects and an eternal being is approvingly presented in IV.x.23. This inference is a poor affair because the existence of matter isnt necessary to the existence of space any more than the existence of motion or of the sun is necessary to duration although duration is commonly measured by motion of the sun. A man can have the idea of ten thousand miles square without any body as big as that as well as the idea of ten thousand years without any body as old as that. . . . Why should we think our idea of innite space requires the real existence of matter to support it when we nd that we have as clear an idea of an innite duration to come as we have of innite duration past In the remainder of this section Locke expands these points somewhat concluding thus If a man had a positive idea of innity whether of duration or of space he could add two innites together making one innite innitely bigger than anotheran absurdity too gross to be worth arguing against. If after all this you still think you do have clear positive comprehensive ideas of innity enjoy your privilege Some of us who dont would like to hear from you about it. Until now I have been apt to think that the great and inextricable difculties that perpetually arise in all discussions about innity whether of space duration or divisibility have been sure signs of a defect in our ideas of innitynamely the disproportion between innity itself and how much our narrow minds can take in. Men talk and dispute about innite space or duration as if they had complete and positive ideas of them. . . .but the incomprehensible nature of the thing they are talking or thinking about leads them into perplexities and contradictions and their minds are swamped by an object too large and mighty to be surveyed and managed by them. If I have lingered rather long on duration space and number and on what arises from thinking about them namely innity it may be no more than the topic requires for there are few simple ideas whose modes give more exercise to the thoughts of men than those do. I dont claim to have treated them in their full extent all I need is to show how the mind receives those ideas such as they are from sensation and reection and how even our idea of innityremote as it seems to be from any object of sense or operation of our mindoriginates in sensation and reection as do all our other ideas. Perhaps some very advanced mathematicians have other ways to introduce ideas of innity into their minds but this doesnt alter the fact that even they like all other men rst acquired their ideas of innity from sensation and reection in the manner I have described. 6 Essay II John Locke xviii Other simple modes Chapter xviii Other simple modes 1. Perhaps I have given enough examples of simple modes of the simple ideas of sensation going so far as to show how from simple ideas taken in by sensation the mind comes to extend itself even to innity. . . . Still for methods sake I shall briey describe a few more simple modes before moving on to ideas that are more complex. Remember that in my classicatory system simple modes are complex ideas though they are less complex than complex modes are 2. To slide roll tumble walk creep run dance leap skip and many others that might be named are words for which every Englishspeaker has in his mind distinct ideas which are all modications of motion. Modes of motion correspond to those of extension swift and slow are two different ideas of motion measured by distances of time and space put together so they are complex ideas comprehending time and space with motion. We have a similar variety with sounds. Every articulate word is a different modication of sound and from hearing such modications the mind can be provided with almost innitely many distinct ideas. Locke also mentions the sounds of birds and beasts and the auditory ideas that a composer may have in his mind when silently composing a tune. Ideas of colours are also very various. We pick out some of them as the different degrees or shades as they are called of the same colour. But since we very seldom put different colours together for use or for pleasure without also giving a role to shapeas in painting weaving needlework etc.the colours that we pick out for attention usually belong to mixed modes as being made up of ideas of two kinds shape and colour as for example beauty rainbow etc. All compounded tastes and smells are also modes made up of the simple ideas of those senses. But because we seldom have names for them we take less notice of them and they cant be explained in writing. Here is a point about simple modes that are considered to be merely different degrees of the same simple idea e.g. Though many of them are in themselves entirely distinct ideas when the difference between them is very small they ordinarily dont have sepa rate names and the differences are not much taken notice of. I leave it to you to think about whether this is because men havent had ways of precisely distinguishing amongst them or rather because distinguishing them wouldnt yield knowledge that would be of general or necessary use. . . . Once the mind has acquired some simple ideas it can variously repeat and compound them and so make new complex ideas. This actually happens with some of our simple ideas and not with others. Though white red sweet etc. In section 7 Locke offers to explain this. The primary concerns of people have been with one another they have mainly needed efcient ways of thinking and talking about 67 Essay II John Locke xix Modes of thinking their own behaviourincluding the actions performed in specialized trades for which technical terms are coined that the rest of the populace wouldnt understand. Ideas such as those of tastes and smells havent had a great role in this kind of thought and speech which is why we have few names for them. Locke undertakes to return to this in III. Chapter xix The modes of thinking 1. When the mind looks in on itself and attends to its own actions thinking is the rst action it encounters. The mind observes a great variety of kinds of thinking receiving different ideas from each. For example the perception that accompanies and is attached to any impression made on the body by an external object gives the mind a distinct idea that we call sensation which is as it were the actual entrance of any idea into the understanding by way of the senses. The same idea when it occurs without the operation of any such object on the organs of sense is remembrance if it is sought by the mind and eventually with considerable effort and difculty brought back into view it is recollection. The section continues with some others contemplation that which the French call rverie attention intention or study dreaming ecstasy. Here and in section 4 Locke uses intention in its old sense of intentness or strenuous mental focus. These are a few examples of the various modes of thinking that the mind can observe in itself and so have distinct ideas of. I dont claim to enumerate them all or to give an extensive treatment of this set of ideas that are acquired from reection for that would ll a book. However I shall later treat at some length reasoning judging volition and knowledge which are some of the most considerable operations of the mind and ways of thinking. Section 3 adds some detail about differences amongst atten tion rverie and dreaming. It ends with this Sometimes the mind xes itself so earnestly on thinking about some objects. . . .that it shuts out all other thoughts and takes no notice of the ordinary impressions that are then being made on the senses. . . . At other times it hardly notices the sequence of ideas that succeed in the understanding and doesnt pursue any of them. And at other times it lets them pass almost entirely unregarded as faint shadows that make no impression. I think everyone must have experienced within himself this difference in degree of intention and of its opposite remission on a scale running from earnest study at one end to very nearly minding nothing at all at the other. Go down the scale a little further still and you nd the mind in sleepwithdrawn from the senses and out of the reach of motions made on the senseorgans that at other times produce very vivid and perceptible ideas. . . . In this state of withdrawal from the senses the mind often retains a looser and less coherent manner of thinking that we call dreaming. Finally sound sleep lowers the curtain in front 68 Essay II John Locke xx Pleasure and pain of the stage putting an end to all appearances. . . . A side remark returning briey to the main topic of i.1022 We all have experience of our minds thinking with various degrees of intensity even a waking man may have thoughts that are so dim and obscure as to be close to having none at all so isnt it probable that thinking is something the soul does but is not its essence a things operations can easily be performed more or less intensely but we dont think of the essences of things as capable of any such variation. Chapter xx Modes of pleasure and pain 1. Among the simple ideas that we receive from both sensation and reection pain and pleasure are two very considerable ones. Bodily sensations may occur alone or accompanied by pain or pleasure and the thoughts or perceptions of the mind may also occur solo or else accompanied by pleasure or pain delight or trouble call it what you will. Like other simple ideas these two cant be described nor can their names be dened the only way to know them is by experience. A denition of them in terms of the presence of good or evil makes them known to us only by making us reect on what we feel in ourselves when we think about or undergo various operations of good and evil. Things then are good or bad only in reference to pleasure or pain. Locke wrote good or evil but in his usage evil means merely bad without the extra force the word has today. When used as a noun as in presence of evil it is left unchanged because bad doesnt work well as a noun. So that the attempt to dene pleasure and pain in terms of good and evil puts things back to front. We call something good if it is apt to cause or increase pleasure or diminish pain in us or else to enable us to get or retain some other good. On the other side we call something bad if it is apt to produce or increase pain or diminish pleasure in us or. . . . I am speaking of pleasure and pain of body or of mind as they are commonly distinguished though really they are all states of the mindsometimes caused by disorder in the body and sometimes by thoughts of the mind. Pleasure and pain and that which causes them good and evil are the hinges on which our passions turn. If we reect on ourselves and observe how these operate in us in various contexts what states of mind and internal sensations if I may so call them they produce in us this may lead us to form the ideas of our passions. Anyone reecting on the thought he has of the delight that any present or absent thing is apt to produce in him has the idea we call love. Locke gives the example of someone whoin season and outloves grapes. On the other side the thought of the pain that anything present or absent is apt to produce in us is what we call hatred. If my theme were not conned to the bare ideas of our passions in their dependence on different kinds of pleasure and pain I would remark that our love and hatred of inanimate or unfeeling things is commonly founded on the 69 Essay II John Locke xx Pleasure and pain pleasure and pain we get from using them and encountering them through our senses even if such use destroys them. But hatred or love towards beings who are capable of happi ness or misery is often the uneasiness or delight that we get just from the thought that they exist or from the thought of their being happy. . . . But it sufces to note that our ideas of love and hatred are merely ideas of the dispositions of the mind to experience pleasure or pain however caused in us. A mans uneasiness over the absence of something whose present enjoyment carries the idea of delight with it is what we call desire which is greater or less according to whether the uneasiness is more or less intense. Locke adds some remarks about uneasiness as the chief if not only spur to human industry and action. He admits that this is off his intended path hell deal with it at length in xxi.2940. Joy is a delight of the mind from the thought of a good that one now possesses or will certainly possess in the future. We are possessed of a good when we have it in our power so that we can use it when we please. Thus a nearly starving man has joy at the arrival of food even before he has the pleasure of eating it. . . . Sorrow is uneasiness in the mind upon the thought of a lost good that might have been enjoyed longer or the sense of a present evil. Hope is that pleasure in the mind that everyone nds in himself when he thinks about a probable future enjoyment of something that is apt to delight him. Fear is an uneasiness of the mind from the thought of future evil that is likely to come to us. Despair is the thought that some good is unattainable. This works variously in mens minds sometimes producing uneasiness or pain sometimes slack passivity. Anger is uneasiness or discomposure of the mind when one is harmed and intends to get revenge for this. Envy is an uneasiness of the mind caused by the thought of a good that we desire that has been obtained by someone we think should not have had it before us. These two last envy and anger are not caused simply by pain and pleasure but have other ingredients in them thoughts regarding oneself or otherswhich is why they arent to be found in all men because some men dont have those thoughts of their own merits envy or of intending revenge anger. All the rest which come down to purely pain and pleasure are I think to be found in all men. For basically we love desire rejoice and hope only in respect of pleasure and hate fear and grieve only in respect of pain. In short all these passions are moved by things only when they appear to be causes of pleasure and pain or to be in some way associated with pleasure or pain. Thus we extend our hatred usually to the subject at least if it is an agent that has perceptions and purposes which has given us pain because the fear it leaves with us is a constant pain. But we dont so constantly love what has done us good because pleasure doesnt operate on us as strongly as pain does and because we arent as apt to hope that a gooddoer will bring pleasure again as we are to fear that a baddoer will bring pain again. But this is by the way. In section 15 Locke repeats that he means pleasure and pain delight and uneasiness to cover mental as well as bodily ups and downs. It should further be noted that so far as the passions are concerned the removal or lessening of a pain is consid ered as a pleasure and operates as such and the loss or diminishing of a pleasure as a pain. 0 Essay II John Locke xx Pleasure and pain 17. Most of the passions in most persons operate on the body causing various changes in it but as these arent always perceptible and indeed in some cases dont occur at all they dont make a necessary part of the idea of each passion. For example shame which is an uneasiness of the mind on the thought of having done something that is indecent or will lessen others valued esteem for us isnt always accompanied by blushing. Dont take me to be offering a treatise on the passions. There are many more of them than I have named and each of those I have attended to merits a much fuller and more detailed treatment. I have mentioned these only as so many instances of modes of pleasure and pain resulting in our minds from various considerations of good and evil. I might perhaps have given instances that are simpler than these and dont count as passions such as the pains of hunger and thirst and the pleasure of eating and drinking to remove them the pain of sore eyes and the pleasure of music the pain of quarrelsome uninstructive argument and the pleasure of reasonable conversation with a friend. But the passions are more important to us than the simpler pleasures and pains which is why I chose to focus on them and to show how our ideas of them come from sensation or reection. 1 Essay II John Locke xxi Power Chapter xxi Power 1. The mind being every day informed by the senses of the alteration of the simple ideas that it observes in things outside it and noticing how one comes to an end and another begins to exist reecting also on what passes within itself and ob serving a constant change of its ideas sometimes by the impression of outer objects on the senses and sometimes by its own choice and concluding from what it has so constantly observed to have happened that similar changes will in the future be made in the same things by similar agents and in similar ways considers in one thing the possibility of having any of its simple ideas changed and in another the possibility of making that change and so comes by that idea that we call power. Thus we say that re has a power to melt gold and gold has a power to be melted. . . . In all such cases the power we think of is in reference to the change of perceivable ideas for we cant observe or conceive any alteration to be made in a thing except by observing or conceiving a change of some of its ideas. Power is twofoldthe ability to make a change and the ability to be changed one may be called active the other passive power. In Lockes usage power doesnt mean strength our nearest word to it is ability or capability sugars passive power to be dissolved in hot water is simply its being able to be thus dissolved. God is entirely above passive power and perhaps matter lacks all active power so that only created minds have powers of both sorts but I shant go into that question. My present business isnt to enquire into what things have power but rather to explore how we come by the idea of it. Still I thought it worthwhile to make the foregoing remarks directing our minds to the thought of God and minds for the clearest idea of active powers because otherwise that might have been lost sight of in what follows. We shall see that active powers loom large in our complex ideas of natural substances and I shall speak of such substances as having active powers following common assumptions about them even though they may not be such genuinely active powers as our casual thoughts are apt to represent them. That is why I have thought it worthwhile to direct our mind to God and spirits for the clearest idea of active power. In xii.3 I announced that the three great categories of complex ideas are those of modes substances and relations. We are still not nished with modes. And yet I admit that power includes in it some kind of relationto action or to changebut then all our ideas turn out on close inspection to involve a relational element. Shape and motion have something relative in them much more obviously. As for sensible qualities such as colours and smells etc.what are they but the powers of different bodies in relation to our perception As for their basis in the things themselves they depend on the volume shape texture and motion of the parts all of which include some kind of relation in them. So our idea of power I think being no more relational than any of the others is entitled to a place among the simple ideas and be considered as one of them being one of the ideas that make a principal 72 Essay II John Locke xxi Power ingredient in our complex idea of substances as we shall see later. Locke should have said a place among the simple modes which he has classied as complex ideassee xii.5. We are abundantly provided with the idea of passive power by almost all sorts of perceptible things. In most of them we cant help noticing that there are continual changes in their sensible qualities and indeed a continual turnover in the stuff they are made of and from this we reasonably infer that they go on being liable to similar changes which is to attribute to them a passive power to be thus changed. We are at least as richly provided with examples of active power which is the more proper meaning of the word power because whatever change we observe the mind must infer an active power somewhere to make that change as well as a passive power a possibility in the thing to undergo the change. But if we think about it hard well see that bodies dont give us through our senses as clear and distinct an idea of active power as we get from reecting on the operations of our minds. All power relates to action and there are just two sorts of action of which we have any idea namely thinking and motion. So let us consider from where we get our clearest ideas of the powers that produce these actions. Body gives us no idea of thinking it is only from reection that we have that. Neither does body give us any idea of the beginning of motion. A motionless body doesnt give us any idea of any active power to move and when a body is put in motion that motion is a passion in it rather than an action something with respect to which it is passive rather than active. For when the ball obeys the motion of a billiard cue that isnt any action on its part but mere passion and when it hits another ball and sets it in motion it only communicates the motion it had received from something else and loses in itself so much as the second ball received. This gives us only a very obscure idea of an active power of moving in body because all we see the body do is to transfer motion not to produce it. For it is a very obscure idea of power that doesnt stretch as far as the production of an action and merely takes in the continuation of a passion. Thats all that is involved in the movement of a body that is put into motion its continuing to move after it has been set in motion is no more an action on its part than is its continuing to be at after something has attened it. The idea of the beginning of motion is one that we get only from reection on what happens in ourselves where we nd by experience that merely by willing somethingmerely by a thought of the mindwe can move parts of our bodies that have been at rest. So it seems to me that our sensory perception of the operations of bodies gives us only a very imperfect and obscure idea of active power since it provides no idea of the power to begin any action whether physical or mental. If you think you have a clear idea of power from your observations of colliding bodies I shant quarrel with you because sensation is one of the ways by which the mind gets its ideas. But I thought it worthwhile to considerjust in passingwhether the mind doesnt receive its idea of active power more clearly from reection on its own operations than from any external sensation. This at least seems to me evident We nd in ourselves a power to begin or not begin and to continue or end various actions of our minds and motions of our bodies by a mere thought or preference of the mind in which it commands so to speak that such and such an action be done or that it not be done. This power that the mind has to order that a given idea be thought about or that it not be thought about or to prefer that a given part of the body move rather than stay still or vice versa is what we call the will. The actual exercise 73 Essay II John Locke xxi Power of that power in a particular case is what we call volition or willing. If your doing x or not doing y results from such an order or command of the mind your doing x or not doing y is called voluntary. And any action that is performed without such a thought of the mind is called involuntary. The power of perception is what we call the understanding. Perception which is the act of the understanding is of three sorts 1 the perception of ideas in our minds 2 the perception of the meanings of signs 3 the perception of the connection or inconsistency agreement or disagreement that there is between any two of our ideas. All these are attributed to the understanding or perceptive power though in ordinary parlance we are said to understand only with the latter two not with the mere perception of ideas in our minds. These powers of the mind namely of perceiving and of preferring are usually called two faculties of the mind. The word faculty is proper enough as long as it isnt allowed to breed confusion in mens thoughts by being taken to stand for some real beingssome thingsin the soul that perform those actions of understanding and volition. For when we say the will is the commanding and superior faculty of the soul the will is or is not free the will determines the inferior faculties the will follows the dictates of the understanding and so on statements like these can carry a clear and distinct sense for anyone who attends carefully to his own ideas and whose thoughts follow the evidence of things rather than the sound of words. But I suspect that this talk about faculties has misled many into a confused notion of active things in us. . . .and that this has led to wrangling obscurity and uncertainty in questions relating to them. Everyone I think nds in himself a power to begin or not begin continue or put an end to various actions in himself. From thoughts of the extent of this power of the mind over the actions of the man the ideas of liberty and necessity arise. These two ideas have been at the heart of an enormous amount of philosophical wrangling encouraged by much confusion. I shall try to sort all that out in the next twenty sections. In section 28 I shall turn to other topics though freedom will return to the spotlight in sections 4756. A man is free to the extent that he has the power to think or not to move or not according to the preference or direction of his own mind. The only actions of which we have any idea boil down to thinking and moving which is why I mention only them. Whenever it is not equally in a mans power to do something x or not to do iti.e. Thus there cant be liberty where there is no thought no volition no will but there may be thought will volition where there is no liberty. Some examples make this clear. Nobody thinks that a tennisball whether moving because it has been hit or lying still on the ground is a free agent. Why Because we dont think of a tennisball as thinking or therefore as having any volition any preference of motion to rest or vice versa. Lacking volition the ball comes under our idea of necessary and that is how we describe it. Another example a man is crossing a bridge when it collapses pitching him into the river below he doesnt have liberty in this and isnt a free agent. He does have volition and prefers 74 Essay II John Locke xxi Power his not falling to his falling but notfalling isnt within his power and so doesnt follow from his volition and therefore in this matter he isnt free. A third example a man strikes himself or a friend through a convulsive movement of his arm that it isnt in his powerby volition or the direction of his mindto stop or refrain from and nobody thinks he has liberty in this everyone sympathizes with him as acting by necessity and constraint. A fourth example a man is carried while fast asleep into a room where there is a person he has been longing to see and speak with and he is there locked in securely when he awakes he is glad to nd himself in such desirable company which he stays in willingly preferring his staying to his going away. Nobody will doubt I think that his staying is voluntary and yet it is clear that being locked in he isnt at liberty not to stay. So liberty is not an idea belonging to volition or preferring but to the persons having the power of doing or not doing something according to what his mind chooses or directs. The moment that power is restrained or some compulsion removes ones ability to act or refrain from acting liberty is extinguished. We have examples of thissometimes too manyin our own bodies. A mans heart beats and the blood circulates and it isnt in his power by any thought or volition to stop either process and therefore in respect to these motions he isnt a free agent. Convulsive motions agitate his legs so that although he wills it ever so much he cant by any power of his mind stop their motion as in that strange disease called St. Vituss dance but he is perpetually dancing he isnt at liberty in this actionhe has to move just as does as a tennisball struck with a racket. On the other side paralysis or the stocks prevent his legs from obeying the decision of his mind when it prefers that they take his body elsewhere. In all these there is a lack of freedom though the sitting still even of a paralytic while he prefers it to a removal is truly voluntary. Voluntary then is not opposed to necessary but to involuntary. For a man may prefer what he can do to what he cant do he may prefer the state he is in to its absence or change even though necessity makes it unalterable. As with the motions of the body so with the thoughts of our minds where any thought is such that we have power to take it up or set it aside according to the preference of the mind there we are at liberty. A waking man being under the necessity of having some ideas constantly in his mind is not at liberty to think or not think any more than he is at liberty to touch other bodies or notgiven that he touches the ground he stands on. But whether he turns his thoughts from one idea to another is often within his choice and then he is as much at liberty in respect of his ideas as he is in respect of bodies he stands on in each case he can move from one to another as he pleases. Still just as some bodily movements are unavoidable so some ideas are unavoidable by the mind which cant drive them away by the utmost effort it can use. A man on the rack isnt at liberty to set aside the idea of pain and distract himself with other thoughts and sometimes a boisterous passion hurries our thoughts along as a hurricane does our bodies without leaving us free to think about other things that we would rather choose. But we consider the man as a free agent again as soon as his mind regains the power to stop or continue begin or not begin any of these thoughts or bodily movements according as it thinks t to prefer either to the other. Necessity occurs where thought is lacking and where thought is present but doesnt have the power to direct 75 Essay II John Locke xxi Power the behaviour. If an agent has thought and is capable of volition but starts or continues some action that is contrary to the preference of his mind that is called compulsion if he stops or restricts an action when this is contrary to his volition this is called restraint. If I am right about all this consider whether it might help to put an end to the question Is mans will free or not This has been long agitated but I think it is unreasonable because unintelligible. It follows from what I have said that the question itself is as improper and meaningless as Is mans sleep swift or not and Is mans virtue square or not because liberty no more applies to the will than speed does to sleep or squareness to virtue. Liberty which is a power belongs only to agents and cannot be an attribute of the will which is only another power. It is so difcult to convey in words clear notions of internal actions that I must warn you that my words order ing directing choosing preferring etc. For example preferring though it seems perhaps best to express the act of volition doesnt do it precisely. A man would prefer ying to walking yet who can say he ever wills himself to y Clearly volition is an act of the mind knowingly exerting that control it takes itself to have over any part of the man so that we cant will ourselves to y because we know that we cant do so. The rest of this section repeats material from preceding sections. Plainly the will is simply one power or ability and freedom is another so that to ask whether the will has freedom is to ask whether one power has another power whether one ability has another abilitya question too obviously and grossly absurd to argue about or to need an answer. For anyone can see that powers belong only to agents and are attributes only of substances and not of powers themselves So that the question Is the will free contains the question Is the will a substance an agent since freedom can properly be attributed only to acting substances. If freedom can with any propriety of speech be applied to any power it is to the power a has man to affect movements of parts of his body by his choice or preference. But his having that power is what entitles him to be called free indeed that power is freedom. So now we have the question Is freedom free and if anyone asked that we would conclude that he didnt know what he was talking about. It would be like someone who knowing that rich was a word to express the possession of riches asks Are riches richmaking himself a candidate for Midass ears 17. But the absurdity is somewhat disguisedits meaning somewhat hiddenwhen men speak of the will as a faculty and slip into thinking of it as an active substance rather than as a power which is what it really is. As soon as it is made clear that the will is merely the power to do something the absurdity of saying that it is or isnt free plainly reveals itself. If it were reasonable to think and talk of faculties as distinct beings that can act The will orders The will is free it would also be all right to have a speaking faculty a walking faculty and a dancing faculty and to think and talk of these as producing the relevant actionsThe singing faculty sings The dancing faculty dances. And when we say such things as that the will directs the understanding or the understanding obeys or disobeys the will this is no more correct and intelligible than to say that the power of speaking directs the power of singing or the power of singing obeys or disobeys the power of speaking. Section 18 continues that last point criticising the state 76 Essay II John Locke xxi Power ment that the understanding operates on the will or the will on the understanding as though a power could operate on a power. I grant that this or that thought may be the occasion of a volition that is of a mans exercising the power he has to choose and that the choice of the mind may cause the mans thinking about this or that thing. Similarly the singing of a tune may cause the dancing of a dance or vice versa. But in all these cases it isnt one power that operates on another. Rather the mind operates and exerts these powers it is the man that does the action it is the agent that has power or ability. For powers are relations not agents and the only thing that can be free or not free is that which has or lacks the power to operate not the power itself. . . . Section 20 continues with the theme of the misuse of the notion of a faculty. Of course the mind and the body have faculties because that is to have powers and they couldnt operate if they had no power to operate. The trouble comes when faculties are treated as things agents rather than as powers and Locke provides examples. To return now to the enquiry about liberty I think the proper question is not Is the will free but Is a man free There are two ways of taking the former question I shall deal with one in the remainder of this section and the other in sections 224. Locke then repeats the position he has already laid out that freedom consists in the ability to act in the manner ones mind chooses. How can we think anyone freer than to have the power to do what he will He concludes So that in respect of actions within the reach of such a power in him a man seems as free as it is possible for freedom to make him. But the inquisitive mind of men who want to clear themselves of guilt as far as they can even if that involves putting themselves into a worse state than that of total necessity is not content with this notion of freedom. For their purposes freedom isnt useful unless it goes further than this. And so we nd people arguing that a man isnt free at all unless he is as free to will as he is free to do what he wills. So a further question about liberty is raised namely Is a man free to will Arguments about whether the will is free are I think really about this. Here is my answer to it. In sections 234 Locke presents one basic point If at some time you have in your mind the question of whether to start walking right now and you do have the power to start walking and also the power not to do so you cannot be free with respect to the relevant act of volition. Either you will start walking or you wont whichever it is will be an upshot of your choosing to walk or choosing not to so you cannot get out of making an act of the will settling the matter and so your act of the will is not free. In such a case whatever you do will be unavoidably voluntary. Plainly then a man is hardly ever at liberty whether to will or not to will. But a new question arises Is a man at liberty to will which of the two he pleases motion or rest This question is so obviously absurd that it might sufce to convince people that the question of freedom shouldnt be asked about the will. To ask whether a man is at liberty to will either motion or rest speaking or silence whichever he pleases is to ask whether a man can will what he wills or be pleased with what he is pleased with. This needs no answer I think and those who insist on asking it must suppose that one act of will arises from another which arises from yet another and so on ad innitum. The best way to avoid such absurdities is to establish in our minds denite ideas of the things we are talking about. If the ideas of liberty and volition were well xed in our 77 Essay II John Locke xxi Power understandings and if we kept them in our minds through all the questions that are raised about liberty and volition it would be easier I think to resolve most of the difculties that perplex mens thoughts and entangle their understandings because it would be easier for us to see where the obscurity arose from the nature of the thing under discussion and where it arose merely from the confused meanings of some words. First then it should be borne in mind that freedom consists in the dependence on our volition or preference of an actions being done or not done not in the dependence on our preference or volition of any action or its contrary. A man standing on a cliff is at liberty to leap twenty yards downwards into the sea not because he has a power to do the contrary action which is to leap twenty yards upwards for he has no such power but because he has a power to leap or not to leap. . . . A prisoner in a room twenty feet square when he is at the north side of the room is at liberty to walk twenty feet southward because he can walk or not walk it but he isnt at the same time at liberty to do the contrary i.e. Freedom then consists in our being able to act or not to act according as we shall choose or will. With that I leave the topic of freedom until I reengage with it in section 47. Secondly we must remember that volition or willing is an act of the mind directing its thought to the performing of some action and thereby exerting its power to produce it. In the interests of brevity I ask permission to use the word action to include also refraining from action. When walking or speaking are proposed to the mind sitting still and staying silent are mere nonactions but they need the determination of the will as much as walking and speaking do and they are often as weighty in their consequences as the other two the real actions. Those are reasons for counting such refrainings as actions too but anyway I am doing so for brevitys sake. Thirdly to the question What determines the will the true answer is The mind. The will is the general power of directing action this way or that it is a power that the agent has and what determines its exercise in a given case is the agent the mind exercising its power in some particular way. If you arent satised with this answer then you must be asking What determines the will with the meaning What moves the mind in every particular instance to perform the particular act of volition that it does perform This is an intelligible and respectable question which doesnt involve treating the will as an agent or anything like that. To this question I answer The motive for continuing in the same state or ac tion is ones present satisfaction in it the motive to change is always some uneasiness. The only thing that ever leads us to will a change of state or the performing of a new action is some uneasiness with our present state or action. This is the great motive that works on the mind getting it to act. For brevitys sake I shall call this determining the will. I shall explain it at more length. First though I must say something about terminology. Volition is a very simple act and if you want to understand what it is you will do better by reecting on your own mind and observing what it does when it wills than by any variety of verbal explanations. Yet I have tried to put it into familiar words by using the terms prefer and choose and their like and these are not really right because they signify desire as well as volition. . . . I nd the will often confounded with. . . .desire and one put for the other. . . . I think that this 78 Essay II John Locke xxi Power has frequently led to obscurity and mistake in this matter and should be avoided as much as possible. If you turn your thought inwards onto what goes on in your mind when you will youll see that the will or power of volition has to do only with actions and nonactions that the mind takes to be in its power. So the will is quite different from desire which may go directly against the will in a particular case. Locke gives two examples this being one a man may be suffering pain knowing that the only way for him to relieve it would give him other worse physical ailments. So he wants the pain to go away but he doesnt will any action that would make it go away. This makes it evident that desiring and willing are two distinct acts of the mind and thus that the will the power of volition is distinct from desire. To return then to the question What determines the will in regard to our actions I used to accept the widespread opinionto which I shall return in section 35that what determines the will is the greater good in view but I now think that what does it is some uneasiness that the man is at present under. That is what determines the will from moment to moment getting us to behave as we do. This uneasiness can be called desire for thats what it is desire is an uneasiness of the mind for the lack of some absent good. All bodily pain of whatever kind and all disquiet of the mind is uneasiness and it is always accompanied byand indeed is hardly to be distinguished froma desire that is equal to the pain or uneasiness that is being felt. For desire being an uneasiness in the lack of an absent good in the case of pain the absent good is ease freedom from the pain and until ease is attained we can call the uneasiness desire for nobody feels pain without wanting to be eased of it with a desire equal in intensity to that pain. Besides this desire for ease from painwhich is essentially a desire for something negativethere is also desire for absent positive good and here also the desire and uneasiness are equal. The more strongly we desire any absent good the more intensely are we in pain from not having it. But the intensity of the pain doesnt vary with how great the good is or is thought to beonly with the strength of the desire for it. Absent good can be contemplated without desire. But when there is desire there is an equally intense uneasiness. Everyone who reects on himself will quickly nd that desire is a state of uneasiness. Everyone has felt in desire what the wise man says of hope which isnt much different from it that it being deferred makes the heart sick Proverbs 1312 and that the greatness of the desire sometimes raises the uneasiness to a level where it makes people cry out Give me children give me the thing desired or I di. Life itself with all its enjoyments is a burden that cannot be borne under the lasting and unremoved pressure of such an uneasiness. It is true that good and evil present and absent work on the mind but what immediately determines the will to each voluntary action is the uneasiness of desire xed on some absent goodwhether the good be negative such as the absence of pain or positive such as pleasure. I shall now try to show by argument and from experience that it is indeed this uneasiness that determines the will to the series of voluntary actions of which the greatest part of our lives is made up. When a man is perfectly content with the state he is in and thus is without uneasiness there is nothing to move him to stop being in that state. Observe yourself and youll see that this is right. And so we see that our Allwise Maker has put into us the uneasiness of hunger and thirst and other natural desires which return at the proper time and 79 Essay II John Locke xxi Power determine our wills for the preservation of ourselves and the continuation of our species. If the mere thought of those good ends had been sufcient to determine the will and set us to work it is reasonable to think we would then have had none of these natural pains and perhaps in this world little or no pain at all. It is better to marry than to burn says St. Paul exhibiting what chiey drives men into the enjoyments of the married state. There is more power in the push of a little actual burning than the pull of the prospect of greater pleasures. It is so widely and condently accepted that what determines the will is good the greater good that I am not surprised that I took this view for granted when I rst published on this topic in the rst edition of this Essay. And I suspect that many readers will blame me not for that but rather for my present retraction. But when I looked harder into the matter I was forced to conclude that even what a person knows to be the greater good doesnt determine his will until his desire has been correspondingly raised and has made him uneasy in his lack of the good in question. Locke gives the example of a poor man who agrees that afuence is better than poverty but who isnt uneasy over his poverty and therefore doesnt bestir himself to get rich and the example of a man who knows that virtue brings advantages but who does nothing about it because he doesnt hunger and thirst after righteousness. He writes colourfully of the alcoholic whose knowledge of what would be better for him leads him frequently to resolve to give up drinking but doesnt lead him actually to give it up because the uneasiness to miss his accustomed delight returns the acknowledged greater good loses its hold and the present uneasiness determines his will to start drinking again. He may at the same time make secret promises to himself that he wont drink any morethat this is the last time hell act against the attainment of those greater goods. And thus he is from time to time in the state of that unhappy complainer who said Though I see and approve the better I follow the worse. We have constant experience of the truth of this for many people at many times I know of no way except mine to make this fact intelligible. Experience makes it evident that uneasiness alone operates on the will but why is this so In answering this I shall assume that whenever volition occurs there is some uneasiness the question being why it and not something else acts immediately on the will in every case. The answer is that at any given time only one item can determine our will and it naturally happens that uneasiness takes that role to the exclusion of anything else that might take it. The reason for that is that while we are in a state of uneasiness we cant sense ourselves as being happy or on the way to happiness because everyone nds that pain and uneasiness are inconsistent with happiness spoiling the savour even of the good things that we do have. So our will always as a matter of course chooses the removing of any pain or uneasiness that we still have as the rst and necessary step towards happiness. Here is another possible reason why the will is immediately determined only by the will and not by the prospect of greater good. The greater good is only prospec tive lying in a possible future it isnt present and actual. Uneasiness is the only relevant factor that is present and it is against the nature of things that something absent should operate where it is not. So a merely future possible good cannot operate in the actual present. You may object that absent good can through thought be brought home to the mind and made to be present. The idea of it may indeed be 80 Essay II John Locke xxi Power in the mind and viewed as present there but for something that is in the mind in that way to counterbalance the removal of an uneasiness that we have it must raise our desire to a point where the uneasiness of that prevails over the other uneasiness in determining the will. Until that happens the idea in the mind of some good is there only in the way other ideas are as merely something to think aboutnot operating on the will and not setting us to work. I shall give the reason for this shortly.. . . . In section 38 Locke writes at length about the fact of sinful conduct by people who really do believe that they are risking the loss of eternal joy in heaven. This would be inexplicable if mere unaided beliefs about the good could determine the will because in that case those beliefs would surely always prevail. But their frequent failure to do so can be understood if one brings in Lockes thesis that uneasiness is what deter mines the will. Near the end he writes Any intense pain of the body the ungovernable passion of a man violently in love or the impatient desire for revenge keeps the will steady and focussed and the will that is thus determined never lets the understanding set its object aside all the thoughts of the mind and powers of the body are uninterruptedly employed in one direction by the determination of the will which is inuenced by that towering uneasiness as long as it lasts. . . . That completes my defence of my view that uneasiness is always what immediately determines the will. The notion of uneasiness will go on working for me but wont itself be the topic of further discussion. Up to here my examples of uneasiness have mainly concerned desire. That kind of uneasiness is the chief determinant of desire and the one we are most conscious of and it seldom happens that the will orders an action without some desire being involved. I think that is why the will and desire are so often taken to be one and the same thing. Still some part in the story should be given to kinds of uneasiness that make up or at least accompany the other passions. Aversion fear anger envy shame etc. Each of those passions usually comes mixed with others. . . .and I think that desire is nearly always an element in the mix. I am sure that wherever there is uneasiness there is desire. Here is why we constantly desire happiness and to the extent that we feel uneasiness to that extent we lack happiness and therefore desire to have it. . . . Also the present moment is not our eternity However greatly we are enjoying the present we look beyond it to the future and desire goes with that foresight and it carries the will with it. So that even in joy what keeps up the action on which the enjoyment depends is the desire to continue it and the fear of losing it. . . . We are attacked by various uneasinesses distracted by different desires which raises the question which of them takes precedence in determining the will to the next action The answer is that ordinarily it the most pressing of them. That is the most pressing of the ones that the person thinks can be removed for the will can never be moved towards something it then thinks is unattainable. . . . What ordinarily determines the will in that series of voluntary actions that makes up our lives is at each moment the most important and urgent uneasiness that we feel at that time. Dont lose sight of the fact that the proper and only object of the will is some action of ours and nothing else. The only outcome we can produce by willing is an action of our own so that is as far as our will reaches. If it is further asked What is it that moves desire I answer Happiness and that alone. Happiness and misery 81 Essay II John Locke xxi Power are the names of two extremes whose outer bounds we dont know. . . . But we have very lively impressions of some degrees of each made by various instances of delight and joy on the one side and torment and sorrow on the other. For brevitys sake I shall bring all these under the labels pleasure and pain because there is pleasure and pain of the mind as well as of the body. . . . Indeed strictly speaking they are all of the mind though some arise in the mind from thought others in the body from certain modications of motion. Happiness then in its full extent is the utmost pleasure we are capable of and misery the utmost pain. . . . Now because pleasure and pain are produced in us by the oper ation of certain objects on our minds or our bodies and in different degrees anything that is apt to produce pleasure in us we call good and what is apt to produce pain we call bad just because it is apt to produce in us the pleasure or pain that constitutes our happiness or misery. Further even when what is apt to bring us some degree of pleasure is in itself good and what is apt to produce some degree of pain is bad we often dont call it so because it is in competition with a greater of its sort. . . . If we rightly estimate what we call good and bad we shall nd it lies to a large extent in comparison the cause of every lesser degree of pain as well as every greater degree of pleasure has the nature of good and vice versa. Although good is the proper object of desire in general sometimes a mans desire remains unmoved by the prospect of good because he doesnt regard that good as a neces sary part of his happiness. Everyone constantly pursues happiness and desires whatever contributes to it other acknowledged goods a person can look at without desire pass by and be content to go without. There is pleasure in knowledge and many men are drawn to sensual pleasures. Now let one man place his satisfaction in sensual pleasures another in the delight of knowledge each admits there is great pleasure in what the other pursues yet neither makes the thing that delights the other a part of his happiness and their desires are not moved that way. As soon as the studious mans hunger and thirst make him uneasy. . . .his desire is directed towards eating and drinking though pos sibly not caring much what food he gets to eat. And on the other side the epicure buckles down to study when shame or the desire to look good to his mistress makes him uneasy in his lack of some sort of knowledge. Thus however intent men are in their pursuit of happiness a man may have a clear view of goodgreat and acknowledged goodwithout being concerned for it or moved by it if he thinks he can be happy without it. But men are always concerned about pain which is an intense uneasiness. They can feel no uneasiness without being moved by it. And therefore whenever they are uneasy from their lack of some good that they think they need for their happiness they start to desire it. Something that each of us can observe in himself is this although the greater visible good doesnt always raise a mans desires in proportion to the greatness he acknowledges it to have every little trouble moves us and sets us to work to get rid of it. The nature of our happiness and misery makes it evident why this should be so. Any present pain of whatever kind makes a part of our present misery but the absence of a good doesnt necessarily do so. If it always did we would be constantly and innitely miserable because there are innite degrees of happiness that we dont possess. So when we are free of all uneasiness a moderate portion of good is enough to keep us content in the present and a fairly 82 Essay II John Locke xxi Power low level of pleasure in a series of ordinary enjoyments adds up to a happiness with which most of us can be satised. If this were not so thered be no room for the obviously trivial actions that we so often exercise our wills on voluntarily spending much of our lives on thema pattern of conduct that couldnt persist if our will or desire were constantly directed towards the greatest apparent good. Few people need go far aeld to be convinced that this is so. In this life indeed most people who are happy to the extent of having a constant series of moderate pleasures with no admixture of uneasiness would be content to continue in this life for ever even though they cant deny that there may be a state of eternal durable joys in an afterlife far surpassing all the good that is to be found in this one. In fact they cant avoid realizing that such a wonderful afterlife is more possible than is their getting and keeping the pittance of honour riches or pleasure that they are now pursuing to the neglect of that eternal state. And yet with a clear view of this difference satised of the possibility of a perfect secure and lasting happiness in a future state and quite sure that it is not to be had in this life while they limit their happiness to some little enjoyment and exclude the joys of heaven from making a necessary part of it still their desires are not moved by this greater apparent good nor are their wills determined to any action or effort towards its attainment. In section 45 Locke discusses at length the phenomenon of people not being moved to seek what they believe are very great longterm goods because their wills are activated by little present uneasinesses aimed at smaller goods that they think of as necessary for their happiness. These dominant uneasinesses may be for food drink and so on but there are also fantastical uneasinesses directed at honour power riches etc. When we are in pain misery uneasiness Locke says the rst thing we need in order to become happy is to get out of that state and in that situation the absence of absent good does not contribute to our unhappiness and so the thought of absent goodeven if we have it and admit that the item in question would be goodis pushed aside to make way for the removal of the uneasinesses that we feel. This situation will change only if appropriate and repeated contemplation of an absent good brings it nearer to our mind gives us a taste of that good and raises in us some desire. That desire then starts to contribute to our present uneasiness and competes with our other uneasinesses in the push to be satised and if it exerts enough pressure it will in its turn come to determine the will. By thoroughly examining any proposed good we can raise our desires to a level that is proportional to how good it is and then it may come to work on the will and be pursued. . . .wills are inuenced only by the uneasinesses that are present to us while we have any of those they are always soliciting always ready at hand to give the will its next push. When any balancing goes on in the mind it isnt a balancing of prospective goods against one another rather it concerns only which desire will be the next to be satised which uneasiness the next to be removed. So it comes about that as long as any uneasiness any desire remains in our mind there is no room for goodconsidered just in itself as goodto come at the will or to have any inuence on it. . . . Despite what I have said in section 40 it doesnt always happen that the greatest and most pressing uneasi ness determines the will to the next action. As we nd in 83 Essay II John Locke xxi Power our own experience the mind is usually able to suspend acting on some one of its desires and sotaking them one at a timeto suspend acting on any of them. Having done this the mind is at liberty to consider the objects of its desiresthe states of affairs that it wants to bring aboutto examine them on all sides and weigh them against others. In this lies mans liberty and all the mistakes errors and faults that we run into in living our lives and pursuing happiness arise from not availing ourselves of this liberty and instead rushing into the determination of our wills going into action before thinking enough about what we are aiming at. When we exercise it and then act we have done our duty all that we can or ought to do in pursuit of our happiness and it isnt a fault but a perfection of our nature to desire will and act according to the last result of a fair examination. This is so far from conning or weakening our freedom that it is the very essence of it it doesnt cut short our liberty but brings it to its proper goal and the further we are removed from such a determinationthat is from being made to act by the judgments we have made and the uneasinesses that result from themthe nearer we are to misery and slavery. If the mind were perfectly indifferent about how to act not xed by its last judgment of the good or evil that is thought to attend its choice that would be a great imperfection in it. A man is at liberty to lift his hand to his head or let it rest in his lap he is perfectly indifferent as between these and it would be an imperfection in him if he lacked that powerthat is if he were unable to lift his hand or unable not to lift it given that no desire of his selects one course of action rather than the other. But it would be as great an imperfection if he had the same indifference as between lifting his hand and not lifting it in a situation where by raising it he would save himself from a blow that he sees coming. It is as much a perfection that desire or the power of preferring should be determined by good as that the power of acting should be determined by the will and the more certain such determination is the greater is the perfection. Indeed if we were determined by anything but the last result of our judgments about the good or evil of an action we would not be free. . . . If we think about those superior beings above us who enjoy perfect happinessthat is the angels in heavenwe shall have reason to judge that they are more steadily determined in their choice of good than we are and yet we have no reason to think they are less happy or less free. And if such poor nite creatures as us were entitled to say anything about what innite wisdom and goodness could do I think we might say that God himself cannot choose what is not good his freedom does not prevent his being determined by what is best. Would anyone choose to be an imbecile so as to be less determined by wise thoughts than a wise man Is it worth the name of freedom to be at liberty to play the fool and draw shame and misery upon oneself Breaking loose from the conduct of reason and lacking that restraint of examination and judgment that keeps us from choosing or doing the worseif that is liberty true liberty then madmen and fools are the only free men Anyone who chose to be mad for the sake of such liberty would have to be mad already. I dont think that anybody thinks that our liberty is restricted in a way we might complain of by the fact that we are constrained to act so as to secure the happiness that we constantly desire. God Almighty himself is under 84 Essay II John Locke xxi Power the necessity of being happy and the more any thinking being is under that necessity the nearer it comes to innite perfection and happiness. To protect usignorant and shortsighted creatures that we arefrom mistakes about true happiness we have been given a power to suspend any particular desire and keep it from determining the will and engaging us in action. This is standing still when we arent sure enough of which way to go. Examination of the possibilities is consulting a guide. The determination of the will after enquiry is following the direction of that guide. And someone who has a power to act or not to act according as such determination of the will directs is free such determination doesnt limit the power in which liberty consists. Someone who has his chains knocked off and the prison doors opened for him is perfectly at liberty because he can either go or stay as he chooses even if his preference is determined to stay because of the darkness of the night the badness of the weather or his lack of anywhere else to sleep. He doesnt stop being free although his desire for some convenience gives him a preferenceall things consideredfor staying in his prison. The liberty of thinking beings in their constant pursuit of true happiness turns on the hinge of their ability in particular cases to suspend this pursuit until they have looked forward in time and informed themselves about whether the particular thing they want and are considering pursuing really does lie on the way to their main end really does make a part of the happiness that is their greatest good. By their nature they are drawn towards happiness and that requires them to take care not to mistake or miss it and so it demands that they be cautious deliberate and wary about how they act in pursuit of it. Whatever necessity requires us to pursue real happiness the same necessity with the same force requires us to suspend action to deliberate and to look carefully at each successive desire with a view to discovering whether the satisfaction of itrather than promoting our happinesswont interfere with our true happiness and lead us away from it. This it seems to me is the great privilege of nite thinking beings and I ask you to think hard about whether the following isnt true The course of mens behaviour depends on what use they make of their ability to suspend their desires and stop them from determining their wills to any action until they have examined the good and evil of the contemplated action fairly and with as much care as its importance merits. This ability is what brings freedom into the lives of menall the freedom they have all they can have all that can be useful to them. This suspension of desire followed by deliberation is something we can do and when we have done it we have done our duty all we can do all we need to do. Since the will needs knowledge to guide its choice all we can do is to hold our wills undetermined until we have examined the good and evil of what we desire. What follows after that follows in a chain of consequences linked one to another all depending on the last ruling of the judgment and we have power over whether that ruling comes from a hasty and precipitate view or from a due and mature examination. In section 53 Locke writes about how greatly people vary in their tastes and in what they think would make them happy and urges the importance of our exercising our freedom to suspend judgment and give ourselves time for further reection and enquiry. In extreme cases one cant do this 85 Essay II John Locke xxi Power for example a man under torture may be unable to refrain from telling his torturers right now what they want to know. And love anger or any other violent passion may have the same effect. But we should work on freeing ourselves from being dominated in that manner. He continues In this we should take trouble to bring it about that whether something is to our minds taste depends on the real intrinsic good or bad that is in it and not permit an admitted or supposed possible great good to slip out of our thoughts without leaving any taste of itself any desire for it until by adequate thought about its true worth we form an appetite in our mind that is suitable to it and make ourselves uneasy in the lack of it or in the fear of losing it. . . . Let noone say he cant govern his passions cant prevent them from taking over and sweeping him into action for what you can do before a prince or a great man you can do alone or in the presence of God if you want to. How does it come about that although all men desire happiness their wills carry them in such contrary directions and thus carry some of them to do bad things What I have said makes it easy to answer this which I do as follows. The various and contrary choices that men make show not that they dont all pursue good but rather that different people nd different things goodthat we dont all place our happiness in the same thing or choose the same way to get it. If we were concerned only with how things go in this life the explanation of why one man devotes himself to study and knowledge and another to hawking and hunting why one chooses luxury and debauchery and another sobriety and riches would not be because some of these didnt aim at their own happiness but because different things make them happy. So the physician was right in what he said to his patient who had sore eyes If you get more pleasure from the taste of wine than from the use of your sight wine is good for you but if the pleasure of seeing is greater to you than that of drinking wine is bad. The mind has its own taste for things as well as the palate and youll do no better trying to delight all men with riches or glory. . . .than trying to satisfy all mens hunger with cheese or lobsters. . . . As pleasant tastes depend not on the things themselves but on how they suit this or that partic ular palate and palates vary greatly so also the greatest happiness consists in having the things that produce the greatest pleasure and not having any that cause disturbance or pain. Now these to different men are very different things. So if men have nothing to hope for in an afterlife if this is the only life in which they can enjoy anything it is neither strange nor unreasonable that they should seek their happiness by avoiding all the things that disease them here and pursuing all that delight them hereand its not surprising that there should be much variety and difference among these. For if there is no prospect beyond the grave the inference is certainly right let us eat and drink let us enjoy what we delight in for tomorrow we shall die Isaiah 2213. This I think may serve to show us why men pursue different ends even though the desires of all of them are bent on happiness. It can happen that men choose different things and they all choose rightlyif we suppose them to have no prospect of an afterlife which involves supposing them to be merely like a crowd of poor insectssome of them bees delighting in owers and their sweetness others beetles enjoying other kinds of foodall of them able to enjoy themselves for a season after which they go out of existence for ever. 6. . . . .Liberty plainly consists in a power to do or not to do as we choose. This much in undeniable but it seems to 86 Essay II John Locke xxi Power cover only the actions of a man resulting from his volition so there remains the question Is he at liberty to will or not In sections 234 I have answered that in most cases a man isnt at liberty to refrain from the act of volition he must exert an act of his will through which the proposed action is done or one through which it is not done. Still in one kind of case a man is at liberty in respect of willing namely in choosing a remote good as an end to be pursued. Here a man can suspend choosing either for or against the thing proposed until he has examined whether it really isor really will lead tosomething that will make him happy. Once he has chosen it thereby making it a part of his happiness it raises desire which gives him a corresponding uneasiness which determines his will which sets him to work in pursuit of his choice. This shows us how a man can deserve punishment even though in all his particular actions he necessarily wills what he then judges to be good. His will is always determined by whatever is judged good by his understanding but that doesnt excuse him if by a too hasty choice of his own making he has adopted wrong measures of good and eviljudgments which however false they are have the same inuence on all his future conduct as if they were true. He has spoiled his own palate and must take responsibility for the sickness and death that follows from that. . . . What I have said may help to show us why men prefer different things and pursue happiness by contrary courses. But since men are always constant and in earnest about happiness and misery the question still remains How do men come to prefer the worse to the better and to choose what they admit has made them miserable In section 57 Locke sketches an answer to his question. Some of the variation and especially some of the conduct that isnt conducive to the happiness of the agent is due to 1 causes not in our power such as extreme pain overwhelm ing terror and so on. The other source of counterproductive behaviour is 2 wrong judgment. Locke deals briey with 1 in this section and devotes sections 5868 to 2. I shall rst consider the wrong judgments men make of future good and evil whereby their desires are misled. Nobody can be wrong about whether his present state considered just in itself and apart from its consequences is one of happiness or misery. Apparent and real good are in this case always the same and so if every action of ours ended within itself and had no consequences we would never err in our choice of good we would always infallibly prefer the best. . . . But our voluntary actions dont carry along with them in their present performance all the happiness and misery that depend on them. They are prior causes of good and evil that come to us after the actions themselves have passed and no longer exist. So our desires look beyond our present enjoyments and carry the mind forward to any absent good that we think is needed to create or increase our happiness. The absent good gets its attraction from the belief that it is needed for happiness. Without that belief we are not moved by absent good. In this life we are accustomed to having a narrow range in which we enjoy only one pleasure at a time and when we have such a single pleasure and have no uneasiness the pleasure is enough to make us think we are happy and we arent affected by all remote good even when we are aware of it. Because our present enjoyment and freedom from pain sufces to make us happy we dont want to risk making any change. . . . But as soon as any new uneasiness comes in our happiness is disturbed and we are set to work again in the pursuit of happiness. 7 Essay II John Locke xxi Power 60. One common reason why men often are not raised to the desire for the greatest absent good is their tendency to think they can be happy without it. While they think that the joys of a future state dont move them they have little concern or uneasiness and the will free from the determination of such desires for distantfuture goods is left to pursue nearer satisfactions removing those uneasinesses that it feels from its lack of them and its longing for them. The remainder of this section develops this line of thought applying it especially to those who ignore the prospects of the afterlife in their pursuit of relatively trivial earthly pursuits. The section concludes For someone whounlike a bee or a beetlehas a prospect of the different state that awaits all men after this life a state of perfect happiness or of misery depending on their behaviour here the measures of good and evil that govern his choice are utterly changed. For no pleasure or pain in this life can be remotely comparable to the endless happiness or intense misery of an immortal soul in the afterlife so his choices about how to act will depend not on the passing pleasure or pain that accompanies or follows them here but on whether they serve to secure that perfect durable happiness hereafter. To understand in more detail the way men often bring misery on themselves although they all earnestly pursue happiness we must consider how things come to be misrepresented to our desires. That is done by the faculty of judgment telling untruths about them. To see what causes wrong judgments and what their scope is we must note that things are judged good or bad in a double sense. In the strict and proper sense only pleasure is good only pain bad. But things that draw pleasure and pain after them are also considered as good and bad because our desiresthose of any creature with foresightaim not only at present pleasure and pain but also at whatever is apt to cause pleasure or pain for us at a later time. The wrong judgment that often misleads us and makes the will choose the worse option lies in misreporting the various comparisons of these consequences that I have just mentioned. I am not talking about one persons opinion about someone elses choices but of the choices a man makes that he himself eventually admits were wrong. Now it is certain that every thinking being seeks happiness which consists in the enjoyment of pleasure without much uneasiness mixed into it and it is impossible that anyone should willingly slip something nasty into his own drink or leave out anything in his power that would help to complete his happinessimpossible that is unless he has made a wrong judgment. . . . Such judgments are of two kinds 1 about the relative goodness or badness of items considered just in themselves and 2 about what the consequences will be of various items. Ill discuss 1 in sections 635 and 2 in sections 667. Yet another kind of judgment will be discussed in section 68. When we compare present pleasure or pain with future which is usually the case in most important questions about what to do we often make wrong judgments about them measuring them differently because of our different temporal distances from them. Nearby objects are apt to be thought to be bigger than ones that are actually bigger but are further away and so it is with pleasures and pains with which the present is apt to win the contest. Thus most men like spendthrift heirs are apt to judge a little in hand to be better than a great deal to come. But everyone must agree whatever his values arethat this is a wrong judgment. That which is future will certainly come to be present and then having the same advantage of nearness will show itself in 88 Essay II John Locke xxi Power its full size revealing the mistake of someone who judged it by unequal measures. In the remainder of the section Locke develops this point at some length with special reference to the drinker who knows hell have a hangover in the morning. It is because of the weak and narrow constitution of our minds that we judge wrongly when comparing present pleasure or pain with future. We cant thoroughly enjoy two pleasures at once much less enjoy a pleasurewith a few exceptionswhile pain possesses us. A present pleasure if it isnt feeble to the point of hardly being a pleasure lls our narrow souls taking up the whole mind so as to leave hardly any room for thoughts of absent things. Even if among our pleasures there are some that arent strong enough to exclude thoughts about things in the future we so intensely hate pain that a little of it extinguishes all our pleasures. So we come to desire to be rid of the present evil whatever the cost we are apt to think that nothing absent can equal it because in our present pain we nd ourselves incapable of any degree of happiness. . . . Nothing we passionately think can exceedhardly anything can equalthe uneasiness that now sits so heavily on us. And not having a present pleasure that is available is a pain often a very great one with ones desire being inamed by a near and tempting object. So it is no wonder that that operates in the same way that pain does lessens future goods in our thoughts and so forces us blindfold so to speak into the embraces of the nearby pleasure. In section 65 Locke makes the point that in our judgments about possible future pleasure of a sort we are unacquainted with we are apt if that pleasure is in competition with something that is closer in time to underestimate the former on the ground that if we actually had it we would nd that it didnt live up to its billing. He continues But this way of thinking is wrong when applied to the happiness of the afterlife. . . . For that life is intended by God to be a state of happiness so it must certainly be agreeable to everyones wish and desire. . . . The manna in heaven will suit everyones palate. . . . When there is a question of some actions being good or bad in its consequences we have two ways of judging wrongly. We may underestimate how bad a given bad consequence would be. We may underestimate the prob ability that a given bad upshot will be a consequence of the proposed actionallowing ourselves to believe wrongly that the threatened consequence may somehow be avoided e.g. I could show case by case that these are wrong ways of judging but I shall merely offer the following general point. It is very wrong and irrational to risk losing a greater good in order to get a lesser one on the basis of uncertain guesses and before the matter has been examined as thoroughly as its importance demands. Everyone must agree with this I think especially if he considers the usual causes of this wrong judgment of which I now describe three. One is ignorance. Someone who judges without in forming himself as fully as he can is guilty of judging amiss. The second is carelessness when a man overlooks things that he does know. This is a sort of selfinduced temporary ignorance which misleads our judgments as much as the other. Judging is like balancing an account to see whether there is prot or loss so if either column is added up in a rush resulting in the omission of some gures that ought to be included this haste causes as wrong a judgment as if it were perfect ignorance. What usually causes it is the domi nation by some present pleasure or pain. Understanding without liberty would be useless and liberty without understanding if there could be such a thing would signify nothing. If a man sees what would do him good or harm make him happy or miserable without being able to move one step towards or from it what good is it to him that he sees it And if someone is at liberty to ramble in perfect darkness how is his liberty any better than if he were driven up and down as a bubble by the force of the wind Being acted on by a blind impulse from within oneself is no better than being acted on by one from outside. So the rst great use of liberty is to hinder blind headlong rushing the principal exercise of freedom is to stand still open the eyes look around and take a view of the consequences of what we are going to dodoing all this with as much thoroughness as the weight of the matter requires. I shant here explore this matter further. . . . I shall consider only one other kind of false judgment which I think I ought to mention because it has great inuence though it may usually be overlooked. All men desire happiness thats past doubt but when they are rid of pain they are apt to settle for any pleasure that is readily available or that they have grown to be fond of and to be satised with that and thus to be happy until some new desire disturbs that happiness and shows them that they are not happy. Some goods exclude others we cant have them all so we dont x our desires on every apparent greater good unless we judge it to be necessary to our happiness if we think we can be happy without it it doesnt move us. This brings up a third way in which men judge wrongly namely by thinking something not to be necessary to their happiness when really it is so. This can mislead us in our choice of goods to aim at and in the means we adopt to achieve a good. We are encouraged to think that some good would not contribute to our happiness by the real or supposed unpleasantness of the actions needed to achieve it for we tend to nd it so absurd that we should make ourselves unhappy in order to achieve happiness that we dont easily bring ourselves to it. We now come to a fourth and nal kind of errornot exactly an error of judgmentthat men can make in their approach to issues concerning goods and happiness. Before presenting it we need to grasp a background fact. It is evident that in many cases a man has it in his power to change the pleasantness and unpleasantness that accom panies a given sort of action. Its a mistake to think that men cant come to take pleasure in something they used to dislike or regard with indifference. In some cases they can do it just by careful thinking in most cases they can do it by practice Application and habit. Bread or tobacco may be neglected even when they are shown to be useful to health because of an indifference or dislike for them. But thought about the matter recommends that they be tried and if they are tried the person nds that they are pleasant after all or else through frequent use they become pleasant to him. This holds in the case of virtue also. Actions are pleasing or displeasing either in themselves or considered as a means to a greater and more desirable end. Locke the makes the point that careful thought about the good to be attained may make one reconciled to the unpleasantness of the means to it whereas use and practice can lead one to enjoy those means nding them pleasant after all. Habits have powerful charms. They put so much easiness and pleasure into what we accustom ourselves to doing that we cant give it up without uneasiness. Though this fact about human nature is very visible and everyones experience 90 Essay II John Locke xxi Power displays it to him it is much neglected as a help to men in their achievement of happiness. So neglected indeed that many people will think it paradoxical to say as I do that men can make things or actions more or less pleasing to themselves and in that way remedy something that is responsible for great deal of their wandering. . . . I shant go on about how men mislead themselves by wrong judgments and neglect of what is in their power. That would make a volume and it isnt my business. But there is one point about it that I shall present here because it is so important. If someone is so unreasonable as to fail to think hard about innite happiness and misery he isnt using his understanding as he should. The rewards and punishments of the afterlife that the Almighty has established as the enforcements of his law have enough weight to determine the choice against whatever pleasure or pain this life can show. For this to be so the eternal state has only to be regarded as a bare possibility and nobody could question that. Exquisite and endless happiness is a possible consequence of a good life here and the contrary state the possible reward of a bad one and someone who accepts this must admit that his judgment is wrong if he doesnt conclude that a virtuous life which may bring the certain expectation of everlasting bliss is to be preferred to a vicious one with the fear of that dreadful state of misery that may overtake the guilty or at best the terrible uncertain hope of annihilation. This would obviously hold good even if the virtuous life here had nothing but pain and the vicious one brought continual pleasure which in fact is far from the case. . . . The worst that comes to the pious man if he is wrong is that there is no afterlife which is the best that the wicked man can get if he is right. With possible innite happiness on the virtue side of the balance and possible innite misery on the vice side it would be madness to choose the latter. . . . If the good man is right he will be eternally happy if he is wrong he wont be miserablehe wont feel anything. On the other side if the wicked man is right he wont be happy he wont feel anything if he is wrong hell be innitely miserable. . . . I have said nothing about the certainty or probability of a future state because I have wanted to show the wrong judgment that anyone must admit that he is makingon his own principlesif he prefers the short pleasures of a vicious life while he is certain that an afterlife is at least possible. 1. . . . .In correcting a slip that I had made in the rst edition of this work I was led to my present view about human liberty which I now repeat before arguing against a rival view that I didnt mention earlier. Liberty is a power to act or not act according as the mind directs. A power to direct the operative faculties to motion or rest in particular instances is the will. What determines the will to any change of operation is some present uneasiness which isor at least is always accompanied bydesire. Desire is always moved to avoid evil because a total freedom from pain is always a necessary part of our happiness. But a prospective greater good may fail to move desire because it doesnt make a necessary part of the persons happiness or because he thinks it doesnt. All that we ever desire is to be happy. But although this general desire of happiness operates constantly and invariably the satisfaction of any particular desire can be suspended from determining the will until we have maturely examined whether the apparent good in question really does make a part of our real happiness. What we judge as a result of that examination is what ultimately determines us. A man couldnt be free if 91 Essay II John Locke xxi Power his will were determined by anything other than his own desire guided by his own judgment. I know that some people equate a mans liberty with his being before his will is determined indifferentthat is able to go either way. I wish those who lay so much stress on this supposed indifference had told us plainly whether it comes before the thought and judgment of the understanding as well as before the decree of the will. It may seem that they have to say that it does. For it is pretty hard to place the indifference between them that is immediately after the judgment of the understanding and before the determination of the will because the determination of the will immediately follows the judgment of the understanding. On the other hand to equate liberty with an indifference that precedes the thought and judgment of the understanding places it in such darkness that we can neither see nor say anything of it. At any rate it gives liberty to something that isnt capable of having it because we all agree that no agent is capable of liberty except as a consequence of thought and judgment. If liberty is to consist in indifference then it must be an indifference that remains after the judgment of the understanding and indeed after the determination of the will because as we have seen it cannot occur before both and cannot come between them either. That however isnt an indifference of the man. He has judged whether it is best to act or not to act and has decided or chosen accordingly so he isnt now indifferent. Rather it is an indifference of his operative powers they are equally able to operate and to refrain from operating now after the wills decree just as they were before it if you want to call this indifference do so This indifference gives a man a kind of freedom for example I have the ability to move my hand or to let it rest that operative power is indifferent as between moving and not moving I am then in that respect perfectly free. My will determines that operative power to keep my hand still but I am free because my operative power remains indifferent as between moving and not moving my will has ordered the keepingstill of my hand but the power to move it hasnt been lost or even lessened that powers indifference as between moving and not moving is just as it was before the will commanded as can be seen if the will puts it to the trial by ordering that my hand move. It would be otherwise if my hand were suddenly paralysed or on the other side if it were set moving by a convulsion in those cases the indifference of the operative faculty is lost. That is the only sort of indifference that has anything to do with liberty. Section 72 opens with Locke saying that he has spent so long on liberty because of the topics importance. He also reports that the view about liberty that he presented in the rst edition came to seem to him wrong and expresses some pride in his willingness to admit to his errors and to correct them. In the remainder of the section he returns to something he said in section 4 namely that when bodies move their movement is given to them by other bodies so that this is passive rather than active power. He now remarks that many mental events exhibit passive rather than active power for example when the mind acquires an idea from the operation of an external substance. He concludes This reection may be of some use to preserve us from mistakes about powers and actions that we can be led into by grammar and the common structure of languagesthe point being that grammatically active verbs dont always signify action. When for example I see the moon or feel the heat of the sun the verbs are active but what they report is no action by me but only the passive reception of ideas from external bodies. On the other hand when I turn my eyes another way or move my body out of the sunbeams I 92 Essay II John Locke xxii Mixed modes am genuinely active because I put myself into that motion of my own choice by a power within myself. Such an action is the product of active power. So now I have presented in compact form a view of our original ideas out of which all the rest are made up. I believe that hard philosophical work would show that all our ideas come down to these very few primary and original ones extension solidity mobility or the power of being moved. We get these ideas from bodies through our senses. Also coining two new words which I think will be useful perceptivity or the power of perception or thinking motivity or the power of moving. We get these from our own minds through reection. When we add existence duration number which come to us through sensation and reection we may have completed the list of original ideas on which the rest depend. For I think that these would sufce to explain the nature of colours sounds tastes smells and all our other ideas if only we had faculties acute enough to perceive the textures and movements of the minute bodies that produce in us those sensations of colour taste and so on. But it is no part of my purpose in this book to investigate scientically the textures and structures of bodies through which they have the power to produce in us the ideas of their sensible qualities. For my purposes it is enough to note that gold or saffron has a power to produce in us the idea of yellow and snow or milk the idea of white which we can only have by our sight I neednt explore the physics of what gives them those powers. Though Ill say just this about the causes of those powers when we go beyond the bare ideas in our minds and start to think about their causes we cant conceive anything in a sensible object through which it could produce different ideas in us except the sizes shapes numbers textures and motions of its imperceptible parts. Chapter xxii Mixed modes 1. In the foregoing chapters xiiixxi I have discussed simple modes showing through examples of some of the most important of them what they are and how we come by them. Now I am ready to consider the ideas that we call mixed modes. Examples are the complex ideas of obligation drunkenness a lie etc. These mixed modes are distinguished from the complex ideas of substances by the fact that they are not looked upon to be typical marks of any real beings that have a steady existence and are only 93 Essay II John Locke xxii Mixed modes scattered and independent ideas put together by the mind. Experience shows us that the mind gets its simple ideas in a wholly passive manner receiving them all from the exis tence and operations of things presented to us by sensation and reection we cant make such an idea for ourselves. But mixed modesour present topicare quite different in their origin. The mind often exercises an active power in making these several combinations once it has some simple ideas it can assemble them into various complexes thus making a variety of complex ideas without examining whether they exist together in that way in nature. I think that is why these ideas are called notions implying that they have their origin and their constant existence more in the thoughts of men than in the reality of things. To form such ideas it sufced that the mind puts the parts of them together and that they were consistent in the understanding without considering whether they had any real being though I dont deny that some of them might be taken from observation. The man who rst formed the idea of hypocrisy might either have taken it at rst from observing someone who made a show of good qualities that he didnt really have or else have formed that idea in his mind without having any such pattern to fashion it by. There must be cases of the latter sort. For it is evident that in the beginning of languages and societies of men some of their complex ideas. . . .must have been in mens minds before they existed anywhere else and that many names standing for such complex ideas were in use before the combinations they stood for ever existed. Now that we have languages that abound with words standing for such combinations one common way of ac quiring these complex ideas is through explanations of the meanings of the terms that stand for them. Because such an idea consists of a number of simple ideas combined the words standing for those simple ideas can be used to explain what the complex one is. This procedure requires only that the pupil understand those names for simple ideas he neednt ever have encountered this particular combination of them in the real world. In this way a man can come to have the idea of sacrilege or murder without ever seeing either of them committed. What gives a mixed mode its unity How do precisely these simple ideas come to make a single complex idea In some cases the combination doesnt exist in nature so that cant be the source of the ideas unity. I answer that the idea gets its unity from the minds act of combining those simple ideas and considering them as one complex idea of which those are the parts and the giving of a name to the complex idea is generally viewed as the nal stage in the process of combination. For men seldom think of any collection of simple ideas as making one complex one unless they have a name for it. Thus though the killing of an old man is as t in nature to be united into one complex idea as the killing of ones father because the former has no name comparable with parricide for the latter it isnt taken for a particular complex idea. . . . Of all the combinations of simple ideas that are in the nature of things t to be brought together into complex ideas men select some for that treatment and neglect others. Why The answer lies in the purposes for which men have language. The purpose of language is for men to show their thoughts or to communicate them to one another as quickly as possible so men usually make and name the complex modes for which they have frequent use in everyday life and conversation and ones that they seldom have occasion to mention they leave loose without names to tie them together. When they do need to speak of one of these combinations 94 Essay II John Locke xxii Mixed modes they can do so through the names of their constituent simple ideas. The alternative is to trouble their memories with the burden of too many complex ideas that they seldom or never have any occasion to make use of. In sections 67 Locke gets two explanations out of his view that complexidea words are coined when needed. It explains he says in section 6 why every culture has words that arent strictly translatable into the language of others and in section 7 why within a single language the meanings of words constantly change. He then returns to his main theme If you want to see how many different ideas are in this way wrapped up in one short sound and how much of our time and breath is thereby saved try to list all the simple ideas that are involved in the meaning of reprieve or appeal 8. Mixed modes are eeting and transient combinations of simple ideas they have a short existence everywhere except in the minds of men and even there they exist only while they are thought of their greatest permanency is in their names which are therefore apt to be taken for the ideas themselves. If we ask where the idea of a triumph. . . .exists it is evident this collection of ideas could not exist all together anywhere in the thing itself for a triumph is an action that stretches through time so that its constituents could never all exist together. Locke is using triumph in its sense of victory parade. This will be dealt with more extensively when I come to treat of words and their use in Book III but I couldnt avoid saying this much at the present stage. So there are three ways in which one can acquire a com plex idea of a mixed mode. By experience and observation of things themselves by seeing men wrestle we get the idea of wrestling. By invention putting together several simple ideas in our own minds he that rst invented printing had an idea of it in his mind before it ever existed. The most usual way by explaining the names of actions we never saw or notions we cant see enumerating all the ideas that are their constituent parts. . . . All our complex ideas are ultimately resolvable into simple ideas out of which they are built up though their immediate ingredients so to speak may also be complex ideas. The mixed mode that the word lie stands for is made of these simple ideas Articulate sounds. Certain ideas in the mind of the speaker. Those words the signs of those ideas. Those signs put together by afrmation or negation otherwise than the ideas they stand for are related in the mind of the speaker. I dont think I need to go any further in the analysis of that complex idea we call a lie. What I have said is enough to show that it is made up of simple ideas and it would be tedious to enumerate every particular simple idea that goes into this complex one. . . . All our complex ideas. . . .can ultimately be resolved or analysed into simple ideas which are the only materials of knowledge or thought that we have or can have. There is no reason to fear that this restricts the mind to too scanty a supply of ideas think what an inexhaustible stock of simple modes we get from number and shape alone So we can easily imagine how far from scanty our supply of mixed modes is since they are made from the various combinations of different simple ideas and of their innite modes. . . . The simple ideas that have been most modied and had most mixed ideas with corresponding names made out of them are these three thinking and motion which cover all action and power from which these actions are thought to ow. Action is the great business of mankind and the 95 Essay II John Locke xxii Mixed modes whole subjectmatter of all laws so it is no wonder that all sorts of modes of thinking and motion should be attended to their ideas observed and laid up in the memory and names assigned to them. Without all this laws could not be well made or vice and disorders repressed. Nor could men communicate well with one another if they didnt have such complex ideas with names attached to them. So men have equipped themselves with settled names and supposedly set tled ideas in their minds of kinds of actions distinguished by their causes means objects ends instruments time place and other circumstances and also of their powers to perform those actions. For example boldness is the power to speak or do what we want publicly without fear or disorder. . . . When a man has acquired a power or ability to do something through doing it frequently we call that a habit when he has a power that he is ready to exercise at the drop of a hat we call it a disposition. Thus for example testiness is a disposition or aptness to be angry. Summing up Let us examine any modes of action for example consideration and assent which are actions of the mind running and speaking which are actions of the body revenge and murder which are actions of both to gether and we shall nd them to be merely collections of simple ideas that together make up the complex ideas signied by those names. Power is the source of all action and the substances that have the powers when they exert a power to produce an act are called causes and what comes about by the exerting of that powera substance that is produced or simple ideas that are introduced into any subjectare called effects. The efcacy through which the new substance or idea is produced is called action in the subject that exerts the power and passion in the subject in which any simple idea is changed or produced. Although this efcacy takes many forms I think that in thinking beings it is conceivable only as modes of thinking and willing and in bodies only as modications of motion. If there is any kind of action other than these I have no notion or idea of it and so it is far from my thoughts apprehensions and knowledge and I am as much in the dark about it as I am about ve extra senses or as a blind man is about colours. Many words that seem to express some action really signify nothing of the actionnothing of the how of itbut merely the effect together with some facts about the thing that causes or the thing upon which the cause operates. Thus for example creation and annihilation contain in them no idea of the action or how it is produced but merely of the cause and the thing done. Similarly when a peasant says Cold freezes water although the word freeze seems to import some specic kind of action all it really means in the mouth of the peasant is that water that was uid has become hard implying no idea of the action through which this is done. In section 12 Locke remarks that his purpose has been to show how words with complex meanings can be dened not actually to dene them all. 6 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances Chapter xxiii Complex ideas of substances 1. The mind is supplied with many simple ideas which come to it through the senses from outer things or through reection on its own activities. Sometimes it notices that a certain number of these simple ideas go constantly together and it presumes them to belong to one thing andbecause words are suited to ordinary ways of thinking and are used for speed and conveniencethose ideas when united in one subject are called by one name. Then we carelessly talk as though we had here one simple idea though really it is a complication of many ideas together. What has happened in such a case is that because we cant imagine how these simple ideas could exist by themselves we have acquired the habit of assuming that they exist in and result from some substratum which we call substance. Substratum what underlies something that serves as the basis or foundation of something else. So that if you examine your notion of pure substance in general youll nd that your only idea of it is a supposition of an unknown support of qualities that are able to cause simple ideas in usqualities that are commonly called accidents. If anyone were asked What is the subject in which colour or weight inheres he would have to reply In the solid extended parts and if he were asked What does that solidity and extension inhere in he wouldnt be in a much better position than the Indian philosopher who said that the world was supported by a great elephant and when asked what the elephant rested on answered a great tortoise. Being further pressed to know what supported the broadbacked tortoise he replied that it was something he knew not what. So too here as in all cases where we use words without having clear and distinct ideas we talk like children who being asked Whats this about something they dont recognize cheerfully answer Its a thing. Really all this means when said by either children or adults is that they dont know what it is and that the thing they purport to know and talk about isnt something of which they have any distinct idea at allthey are indeed perfectly in the dark about it. So the idea of ours to which we give the general name substance being nothing but the supposed but unknown support of those qualities we nd existing and which we imagine cant exist sine re substantethat is without some thing to support themwe call that support substantia which according to the true meaning of the word is in plain English standing under or upholding. Sub is Latin for under and stans is Latin for standing so substans English substance literally means something that stands under something. In this way we form an obscure and relative idea of substance in general. It is relative because it isnt an idea of what substance is like in itself but only an idea of how it relates to something else namely the qualities that it upholds or stands under. From this we move on to having ideas of various sorts of substances which we form by collecting combinations of simple ideas that we nd in our ex perience tend to go together and which we therefore suppose to ow from the particular internal constitution or unknown essence of a substance. Thus we come to have the ideas of a man horse gold water etc. If you look into yourself youll nd that your only clear idea of these sorts of substances is the idea of certain simple ideas existing together. It is the combination of ordinary qualities observable in iron or a diamond that makes the true complex idea of those kinds of substanceskinds that a smith or a jeweller commonly 97 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances knows better than a philosopher does. Whatever technical use he may make of the term substance the philosopher or scientist has no idea of iron or diamond except what is provided by a collection of the simple ideas that are to be found in themwith one further ingredient. So when we speak of any sort of substance we say it is a thing having such or such qualities body is a thing that is extended shaped and capable of motion spirit a thing that can think and we say that hardness and power to attract iron are qualities to be found in a loadstone conceived of as a thing containing these qualities. Loadstone is a kind of rock that is naturally magnetic. These and similar ways of speaking show that the substance is always thought of as some thing in addition to the extension shape solidity motion thinking or other observable ideas though we dont know what it is. Locke uses spirit as he does soul to mean merely thing that thinks or thing that has mental properties. It doesnt mean something spiritual in any current sense of the term. So when we talk or think of any particular sort of corporeal substancese.g. We are led to think in this way because we cant conceive how qualities could exist unsupported or with only one another for support. The same thing happens concerning the operations of the mindthinking reasoning fearing etc. These cant exist by themselves we think nor can we see how they could belong to body or be produced by it so we are apt to think that they are the actions of some other substance which we call spirit. We have as clear a notion of the substance of spirit as we have of body. The latter is supposed without knowing what it is to be the substratum of those simple ideas that come to us from the outside and the former is supposed still not knowing what it is to be the substratum of the mental operations we experience within ourselves. Clearly then we have as poor a grasp of the idea of bodily substance as we have of spiritual substance or spirit. So we shouldnt infer that there is no such thing as spirit because we have no notion of the substance of spirit any more than we should conclude that there is no such thing as body because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of matter. Whatever the secret abstract nature of substance in general may be therefore all our ideas of particular sorts of substances are nothing but combinations of simple ideas coexisting in some unknown cause of their union. We represent particular sorts of substances to ourselves through such combinations of simple ideas and in no other way. They are the only ideas we have of the various sorts of thingsthe sorts that we signify to other people by means of such names as man horse sun water iron. Anyone who hears such a word and understands the language forms in his mind a combination of those simple ideas that he has foundor thinks he has foundto exist together under that name all of which he supposes to rest in and be xed to that unknown common subject that doesnt inhere in anything else in its turn. Consider for instance the idea of the sun it is merely a collection of the simple ideas bright hot roundish having a constant regular motion at a certain distance from usand perhaps a few others depending on how accurately the owner of the idea has observed the 98 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances properties of the sun. The most perfect idea of any particular sort of substance results from putting together most of the simple ideas that do exist in iti.e. These are not simple ideas but for brevitys sake let us here pretend that they are. Thus the complex idea of the substance that we call a loadstone has as a part the power of attracting iron and a power to be attracted by a loadstone is a part of the complex idea we call iron. These powers are counted as inherent qualities of the things that have them. Every substance is as likely through the powers we observe in it a to change the perceptible qualities of other subjects as b to produce in us those simple ideas that we receive immediately from it. When b happens with re say our senses perceive in re its heat and colour which are really only the res powers to produce those ideas in us. When a happens we also learn about the re because it acts on us mediately by turning wood into charcoal and thereby altering how the wood affects our senses. . . . In what follows I shall sometimes include these powers among the simple ideas that we gather together in our minds when we think of particular substances. Of course they arent really simple but they are simpler than the complex ideas of kinds of substance of which they are merely parts. It isnt surprising that powers loom large in our complex ideas of substances. We mostly distinguish substances one from another through their secondary qualities which make a large part of our complex ideas of substance. Our senses will not let us learn the sizes textures and shapes of the minute parts of bodies on which their real constitutions and differences depend so we are thrown back on using their secondary qualities as bases for distinguishing them one from another. And all the secondary qualities as has been shown in viii are nothing but powers. . . . The ideas that make our complex ideas of bodily sub stances are of three sorts. First the ideas of the primary qualities of things including the size shape number posi tion and motion of the parts of bodies. We discover these by our senses but they are in the bodies even when we dont perceive them. Secondly the sensible secondary qualities. They depend on the primary qualities and are nothing but the powers that bodies have to produce certain ideas in us through our senses. These ideas are not in the things themselves except in the sense that a thing is in its cause. Thirdly when we think that one substance can cause an alteration in the primary qualities of another so that the altered substance would produce in us different ideas from what it did before we speak of the active powers of the rst substance and the passive powers of the second. We know about the powers of things only through sensible simple ideas. For example whatever alteration a loadstone has the power to make in the minute particles of iron we wouldnt suspect that it had any power to affect iron if that power werent revealed by how the loadstone makes the iron particles move. I have no doubt that bodies that we handle every day have powers to cause thousands of changes in one anotherpowers that we never suspect because they never appear in sensible effects. So it is proper that powers should loom large in our complex ideas of substances. If you examine your complex idea of gold youll nd that several of the ideas that make it up are only ideas of powers. For example the power of being melted without being burned away and the power of being dissolved in aqua regia a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acidsthese ideas are as essential to our complex idea of 99 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances gold as are its colour and weight. Indeed colour and weight when properly understood turn out also to be nothing but powers. For yellowness is not actually in gold but is a power that gold has when placed in proper light to produce a certain idea in us through our eyes. Similarly the heat that we cant leave out of our idea of the sun is no more really in the sun than is the white colour it gives to wax. These are both equally powers in the sun which operates on a manthrough the motion and shape of its sensible partsso as to make him have the idea of heat just as it operates on wax so as to make it capable of producing in a man the idea of white. If our senses were sharp enough to distinguish the minute particles of bodies and the real constitution on which their sensible qualities depend I am sure they would produce in us ideas quite different from the ones they now produce the yellow colour of gold for example would be replaced by an admirable texture of parts of a certain size and shape. Microscopes plainly tell us this for what to our naked eyes produces a certain colour is revealed through a microscope to be quite different. Thus sand or ground glass which is opaque and white to the naked eye is transparent under a microscope and a hair seen this way loses its former colour and is mostly transparent with a mixture of bright sparkling colours like the ones refracted from a diamond. Blood to the naked eye appears all red but when its lesser parts are brought into view by a good microscope it turns out to be a clear liquid with a few red globules oating in it. We dont know how these red globules would appear if glasses could be found that would magnify them a thousand or ten thousand times more. God in his innite wisdom has given us senses faculties and organs that are suitable for the conveniences of life and for the business we have to do here. But it seems that God didnt intend that we should have a perfect clear and adequate knowledge of things and perhaps no nite being can have such knowledge. These are our business in this world. But if our senses were made much keener and more acute the surface appearances of things would be quite different for us and Im inclined to think that this would be inconsistent with our survivalor at least with our wellbeingin this part of the universe that we inhabit. Think about how little we are tted to survive being moved into air not much higher than the air we commonly breathethat will give you reason to be satised that on this planet that has been assigned as our home God has suited our organs to the bodies that are to affect them and vice versa. If our sense of hearing were merely one thousand times more acute than it is how distracted we would be by perpetual noise Even in the quietest retirement we would be less able to sleep or meditate than we are now in the middle of a seabattle. If someones eyesight the most instructive of our senses were a thousand or a hundred thousand times more acute than it is now through the best microscope he would be able to see with his naked eyes things several million times smaller than the smallest object he can see now and this would have a good result and a bad one. It would bring 100 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances him nearer to discovering the texture and motion of the minute parts of corporeal things and he would probably get ideas of the internal structures of many of them. But then he would be in a quite different world from other people nothing would appear the same to him as to others the visible ideas of everything would be different. So that I dont think that he could converse with others concerning the objects of sight or communicate in any way about colours their appearances being so wholly different. The section continues with further remarks about the disadvantages of having such microscopical eyes if I may so call them. It ends thus Someone who was sharpsighted enough to see the arrangement of the minute particles of the spring of a clock and observe the special structure and ways of moving on which its elastic motion depends would no doubt discover something very admirable. But if his eyes were so formed that he couldnt tell the time by his clock because he couldnt from a distance take in all at once the clockhand and the numerals on the dial he wouldnt get much advantage from the acuteness of his sight it would let him in on the structure and workings of the parts of the machine while also making it useless to him In section 13an admitted interruption of the main line of thoughtLocke remarks that the structure of our sense organs is what sets limits to what we can perceive in the material world and offers his extravagant conjecture about Spirits here meaning something like angels. Assuming that they sometimes have bodies angels may be able to alter their sense organs at will thus being able to perceive many things that we cant. Locke cant hide his envy about this though he says that no doubt God has good reasons for giving us senseorgans that we cannot ex at will like muscles. Each of our ideas of a specic kind of substances is nothing but a collection of simple ideas considered as united in one thing. These ideas of substances though they strike us as simple and have simple words as names are nevertheless really complex and compounded. Thus the idea that an Englishman signies by the name swan is white colour long neck red beak black legs and webbed feet and all these of a certain size with a power of swimming in the water and making a certain kind of noiseand perhaps other properties as well for someone who knows a lot about this kind of birdall united in one common subject. Besides the complex ideas we have of material sensi ble substances we can also form the complex idea of an immaterial spirit. We get this through the simple ideas we have taken from operations of our own minds that we experience daily in ourselves such as thinking understanding willing knowing and power of beginning motion etc. By putting these ideas together we have as clear a perception and notion of imma terial substances as we have of material ones. For putting together the ideas of thinking and willing and the power of starting or stopping bodily motion joined to substance of which we have no distinct idea we have the idea of an immaterial spirit and by putting together the ideas of solid parts that hold together and a power of being moved joined with substance of which likewise we have no positive idea we have the idea of matter. Here positive contrasts with relative. The idea of substance in general is relative because it is only the idea of whateveritis that relates to qualities by upholding and uniting them. 01 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances The one is as clear and distinct an idea as the other the ideas of thinking and moving a body being as clear and distinct as the ideas of extension solidity and being moved. For our idea of substance is equally obscure or none at all in both It is merely a supposed I know not what to support qualities. Those who believe that our senses show us nothing but material things havent thought hard enough When you think about it youll realize that every act of sensation gives us an equal view of both parts of nature the corporeal and the spiritua. For while I know by seeing or hearing etc. This seeing and hearing cant be done by mere senseless matter it couldnt occur except as the action of an immaterial thinking being. All that we know of body is contained in our complex idea of it as extended shaped coloured and having other sensible qualities and all this is as far from the idea of the substance of body as we would be if we knew nothing at all. And although we think we are very familiar with matter and know a great deal about many of its qualities it may turn out that our basic ideas of body are no more numerous and no clearer than our basic ideas of immaterial spirit. The basic ideas that we have that apply to body and not to spirit are the holding together of parts that are solid and therefore separable and a power of causing things to move by colliding with them. Bodies also have shapes but shape is merely a consequence of nite extension. The ideas we have belonging exclusively to spirit are thinking and will which is the power of putting body into motion by thought and liberty. Whereas a body cant help setting in motion a motionless body with which it collides the mind is at liberty to put bodies into motion or refrain from doing so as it pleases. The ideas of existence duration and mobility are common to both body and spirit. It shouldnt be thought strange that I attribute mobility to spirit. Spirits like bodies can only operate where they are we nd that a single spirit operates at different times in different places so I have to attribute change of place to all nite spirits Im not speaking of God the innite spirit here. For my soul is a real thing just as much as my body is and is equally capable of changing its distance from any other spatially located being and so it is capable of motion. . . . Everyone nds in himself that his soul can think will and operate on his body in the place where that body is but cannot operate on a body or in a place a hundred miles away. You cant imagine that your soul could think or move a body in Oxford while you are in London and you have to realize that your soul being united to your body continually changes its location during the whole journey between Oxford and London just as does the coach or horse that you ride onso I think it can be said to be truly in motion throughout that journey. If that isnt conceded as giving a clear idea enough of the souls motion you will get one from the thought of its being separated from the body in death for it seems to impossible that you should think of it as leaving the body while having no idea of its motion. In section 21 Locke discusses a scholastic reason for deny ing that souls or spirits can move and derisively challenges its supporters to put it into intelligible English. He con cludes Indeed motion cannot be attributed to Godnot because he is an immaterial spirit but because he is an innite one. 02 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances 22. Let us compare our complex idea of immaterial spirit with our complex idea of body and see whether one is more obscure than the otherand if so which. Which of these is more obscure and harder to grasp I know that people whose thoughts are immersed in matter and have so subjected their minds to their senses that they seldom reect on anything that their senses cant reach are apt to say that they cant comprehend a thinking thing. Perhaps they cant but then if they think hard about it theyll realize that they cant comprehend an extended thing either. If anyone says I dont know what it is that thinks in me he means that he doesnt know what the substance is of that thinking thing. I respond that he has no better grasp of what the substance is of that solid thing. If he also says I dont know how I think I respond that he also doesnt know how he is extendedthat is how the solid parts of body cohere together to make extension. I shall discuss the cohesion problemthe problem of explaining how portions of matter hang together to compose planets or pebbles or grains of sandfrom here through to the end of section 27. The pressure of the particles of air may account for the cohesion of some parts of matter that are bigger than the particles of air and have pores that are smaller than those particles but that cant explain the coherence of the particles of air themselves. Whatever holds them together it isnt the pressure of the air And if the pressure of any matter that is ner than the airsuch as the ethercan unite and hold together the parts of a particle of air as well as of other bodies it still cant make bonds for itself and hold together the parts that make up every least particle of that materia subtili. Thus however ingeniously we develop our explanation of how the parts of perceptible bodies are held together by the pressure of other imperceptible bodies such as the particles of the ether that explanation doesnt extend to the parts of the ether itself. The more success we have in showing that the parts of other bodies are held together by the external pressure of the ether and can have no other conceivable cause of their cohesion and union the more completely we are left in the dark about what holds together the parts of each particle of the ether itself. We cant conceive of those particles as not having parts because they are bodies and thus divisible but we also cant conceive of how their parts cohere because the explanation of how everything else coheres cannot be applied to them. The foregoing argument shows that even if pressure from the ether could explain the cohesion of most bodies it leaves unexplained the cohesion of the particles of the ether itself. But in fact pressure however great from a surrounding uid such as the ether cannot be what causes the cohesion of the solid parts of matter. Such a pressure might prevent two things with polished surfaces from moving apart in a line perpendicular to those surfaces. . . .but it cant even slightly hinder their pulling apart in a line parallel to those surfacesI shall call this a lateral motion. The surrounding uid is free to occupy each part of space that is deserted through such a lateral motion so it doesnt resist such a motion of bodies joined in that way any more than it would resist the motion of a body that was surrounded on all sides by that uid and didnt touch any other body. 03 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances And therefore if there were no other cause of cohesion than this surroundinguid one all parts of all bodies would be easily separable by such a lateral sliding motion. So it is no harder for us to have a clear idea of how the soul thinks than to have one of how body is extended. For the extendedness of body consists in nothing but the union and cohesion of its solid parts so we shall have a poor grasp of the extension of body when we dont understand the union and cohesion of its parts and we dont understand that any more than we understand what thinking is and how it is performed. Most people would wonder how anyone should see a difculty in what they think they observe every day. Dont we see the parts of bodies stick rmly together Is there anything more common And what doubt can there be made of it And similarly with regard to thinking and voluntary motion Dont we experience it every moment in ourselves So can it be doubted The matter of fact is clear I agree but when we want to look more closely and think about how it is done we are at a loss both about extension and about thought. . . . The little bodies that compose the uid we call water are so extremely small that I have never heard of anyone claiming to see their distinct size shape or motion through a microscope and Ive heard of microscopes that have mag nied up to a hundred thousand times and more. And the particles of water are also so perfectly loose one from another that the least force perceptibly separates them. Indeed if we think about their perpetual motion we must accept that they dont cohere with another and when a sharp cold comes they unite they consolidate these little atoms cohere and they cant be separated without great force. Something we dont yet knowand it would be a great discoveryis what the bonds are that tie these heaps of loose little bodies together so rmly what the cement is that sticks them so tightly together in ice. But someone who made that discovery would still be long way from solving the general problem making intelligible the extension of body which is the cohesion of its solid parts. For that he would need to show how the parts of those bondsor of that cement or of the least particle of matter that existshold together. It seems then that this primary and supposedly obvious quality of body extension turns out when examined to be as incomprehensible as anything belonging to our minds and that it is as hard to conceive a solid extended substance as it is to conceive a thinking immaterial one. . . . Here is a further difculty about solving the cohesion problem through an appeal to surrounding pressures. Let us suppose that matter is nite as no doubt it is. Now think about the outermost bounds of the universe and ask yourself What conceivable hoops what bond can hold this unied mass of matter together with a pressure from which steel must get its strength and diamonds their hardness and indissolubility If matter is nite it must have boundaries and there must be something that stops it from scattering in all directions. If you try to avoid this latest difculty by supposing that the material world is innite in extent ask yourself what light you are throwing on the cohesion of bodywhether you are making it more intelligible by relying on the most absurd and incomprehensible of all suppositions. So far is our idea of the extension of body which is nothing but the cohesion of solid parts from being clearer or more distinct when we enquire into the nature cause or manner of it than is the idea of thinking 104 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances 28. Another idea that we have of body is the idea of the power of transferring motion by impact and of our souls the idea of the power of exciting motion by thought. Everyday experience clearly provides us with these two ideas but here again if we enquire how each power is exercised we are equally in the dark. In the most usual case of motions being communicated from one body to another through impact the former body loses as much motion as the other acquires and the only conception we have of what is going on here is that motion passes out of one body into the other. That seems to me to be as obscure and inconceivable as how our minds move or stop our bodies by thought which we every moment nd they do. Daily experience provides us with clear evidence of motion produced by impact and of motion produced by thought but as for how this is done we are equally at a loss with both. So that when we think about the communication of motion whether by body or by spirit the idea of it that is involved in spiritasmover is at least as clear as the one involved in bodyasmover. And if we consider the active power of moving called motivity in xxi.73 it is much clearer in spirit than body. Place two bodies at rest side by side they give us no idea of a power in the one to move the other except through a borrowed motion. The mind on the other hand every day gives us ideas of an active power of moving bodies. This gives us reason to think that active power may be the proper attribute of spirits and passive power the proper attribute of matter. If that is so then created spirits are not totally other than matter because as well as being active as matter isnt they are also passive as matter is. Pure spirit namely God is only active pure matter is only passive and beings like us that are both active and passive may be judged to involve both. . . . In conclusion Sensation convinces us that there are solid extended substances and reection that there are thinking ones. Experience assures us that one has a power to move body by impact the other by thought. That much is sure and we have clear ideas of it but we cant go any further. If we start asking about nature causes and manner of operation we see no more clearly into the nature of extension than we do into the nature of thinking. It is no harder to conceive how a substance that we dont know should by thought set body into motion than how a substance that we dont know should by impact set body into motion. . . . In sections 3031 Locke sums up the results of the last few sections reemphasizing that the idea of a thinking substance is not less respectable than that of an extended substance. He concludes section 31 with a new difculty about the latter Nothing in our notion of spirit is more perplexed or nearer a contradiction than something that the very notion of body includes in it namely the innite divisi bility of any nite extended thing. Whether we accept this or reject it we land ourselves in consequences that we cant ex plain or make consistent within our thoughtconsequences that carry greater difculty and more apparent absurdity than anything that follows from the notion of an immaterial knowing substance. In section 32 Locke starts by rehearsing the arguments he has given for the view that we have as much reason to be satised with our notion of immaterial spirit as with our notion of body and of the existence of the one as well as of the other. He then launches without announcing that he is doing so into a new issue is a human being an extended thing that thinks or rather a pair of things of which one is extended and the other thinks It is no 105 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances more a contradiction that thinking should exist separate and independent from solidity than that solidity should exist separate and independent from thinking. Thought and extension are simple ideas independent one from another and we are as entitled to allow a thinking thing without solidity as we are a solid thing without thinking. It may be hard to conceive how thinking could occur without matter but its at least as hard to conceive how matter could think. Whenever we try to get beyond our simple ideas to dive deeper into the nature of things we immediately fall into darkness and obscurity perplexity and difculties. But whichever of these complex ideas is clearer that of body or that of immaterial spirit each is evidently composed of the simple ideas that we have received from sensation or reection. So are all our other ideas of substances even that of God himself. In section 33 Locke develops that last remark contending that we can build up our idea of God as innitely powerful wise etc. If I nd that I know a few things some or all of them imperfectly I can form an idea of knowing twice as many which I can double again and so on indenitely just as I can generate an endless series of numbers by repeated doubling. In that way I can enlarge my idea of knowledge by extending its coverage to all things existing or possible. And I can do the same with regard to knowing them more perfectly thus forming the idea of innite or boundless knowledge. The same may also be done for power. . . .and also for the duration of existence. . . . We form the best idea of God that our minds are capable of by taking simple ideas from the operations of our own minds through reection or from exterior things through our senses and enlarging them to the vastness to which innity can extend them. It is innityjoined to existence power knowledge etc.that makes our complex idea of God. Although in his own essence which we dont know any more than we know the real essence of a pebble or of a y or of ourselves God may be simple and uncompounded still our only idea of him is a complex one whose parts are the ideas of existence knowledge power happiness etc.all this innite and eternal. . . . Apart from innity there is no idea we attribute to God that isnt also a part of our complex idea of other Spirit. We can attribute to Spirits only ideas that we get from reection and we can differentiate them from God on one side and from us on the other only through differences in the extent and degree of knowledge power duration happiness etc. Here is another bit of evidence that we are conned to the ideas that we receive from sensation and reection even if we think of unembodied Spirits as ever so much even innitely more advanced than bodies are we still cant have any idea of how they reveal their thoughts one to another. We have to use physical signs and particular sounds they are the best and quickest we are capable of which makes them the most useful we can nd. Of course unembodied Spirits must have also a more perfect way of communicating their thoughts than we have but of such immediate communication we have no experience in ourselves and consequently no notion at all. Now we have seen what kind of ideas we have of sub stances of all kinds what they consist in and how we came by them. All this I think makes three things very evident. All our ideas of the various sorts of substances are nothing but collections of simple ideas together with a supposition 106 Essay II John Locke xxiv Collective ideas of something to which they belong and in which they exist though we have no clear distinct idea at all of this supposed something. All the simple ideas whichwhen thus united in one common substratummake up our complex ideas of various sorts of substances are received from sensation or reection. Even those extremely familiar ideas that apply to almost everythingsuch as the ideas of time motion body thought feelinghave such simple ideas of sensation and reection as their only ingredients. So do the ideas that seem furthest from having any connection with us and that innitely surpass anything we can perceive in ourselves by reection or discover by sensation in other things. Even those ideas must be constructed out of the simple ideas that we originally received from sensation or reection. This is clearly the case with respect to the complex ideas we have of angels and especially our idea of God. Most of the simple ideas that make up our complex ideas of substances are really only ideas of powers however apt we are to think of them as ideas of positive qualities. Here again positive contrasts with relative. For example most of the ideas that make our complex idea of gold are yellowness great weight ductility fusibility and solubility in aqua regia etc. To be heavy is to have a power to outweigh other things to be yellow is to have a power to cause certain visual sensations in human observers. Ductility is the ability to be drawn out into a thin wire and fusibility is the ability to melt when hot neither of which is a relation to other substances. Perhaps Locke has a different thought at work here not properly expressed he may be contrasting positive qualities not only with relative qualities but also with conditional ones. Attributing a power to something is asserting a conditional about itIf it is heated it will melt. A positive quality such as squareness isnt like that the thing just is square and if doesnt come into it. These powers depend on the real and primary qualities of the golds internal constitution they are what give it its power to operate on other substances and to be operated on by them but the powers arent really in the gold considered purely in itself. Chapter xxiv Collective ideas of substances 1. Besides these complex ideas of various kinds of single substancesman horse gold violet apple etc. Such ideas are made up of many particular substances considered together as united into one idea and which so joined are looked on as one. For example the idea of a collection of men that make an army though it consists of a great many distinct substances is as much one idea as the idea of a man. Similarly with the great collective idea of all bodies whatsoever signied by the name world. . . . In section 2 Locke contends that power of the mind whereby it makes collective ideas out of complex ideas of individuals is the very one by which it makes the latter ideas out of simple ones. The crux is this It is no harder to conceive how an army of ten thousand men should make one idea 107 Essay II John Locke xxiv Collective ideas than to conceive how a man should make one idea. Each involves constructing a complex out of parts that are simple or simpler. Artifacts or at least the ones that are made up of distinct substancese.g. Not only do manmade things tend to fall under collective ideas but conversely collective ideas are in a special way manmade. All our collective ideassuch as those of army constellation universeare merely articial representations made by the mind. Such an idea gathers into a single view under a single name things that are very remote from and independent of one another so as better to think and talk about them. As the meaning of the word universe shows no things are so remote or unalike that the mind cant bring them under a single idea by this technique of composition. 08 Essay II John Locke xxv Relation Chapter xxv Relation 1. Besides the ideas simple and complex that the mind has of things considered on their own it gets other ideas from comparison between different things. For Locke a comparison can be any kind of considering together of two things not necessarily likening them to one another. When the understanding thinks about a thing it isnt conned to that precise object it can look beyond it to see how it relates to some other thing. When the mind sets one thing alongside another so to speak and carries its view from one to the other this is what we call relation and respect. A word is called relative if applying it to one thing signies such a respect and leads the thought from the original subject to something else. The things that are thus brought together are said to be related. Locke develops all this at some length contrasting the nonrelational thought that Caius is white with the relational thoughts that Caius is a husband and that Caius is whiter than freestone. Section 2 points out that many relative terms come in pairs father and son bigger and smaller. Some relative terms could be paired in this way but happen not to be Locke gives the example of concubine. He concludes All names that are more than empty sounds must signify some idea that either is an idea of a quality in the thing to which the name is applied and then it is positive and is looked on as united to and existing in the thing in question or arises from the respect or relation the mind nds the thing to bear to some other thing and then it includes a relation. In section 3 Locke mentions terms that are tacitly relative though they are sometimes not seen to be sofor example old great imperfect etc. Section 4 points out that two people might have very different ideas of man yet exactly the same idea of fatherhooddifferent relata same relation. Section 5 points out that a relation ceases to hold if one of the related things ceases to exist. When his only child dies Caius ceases to be a father though he hasnt altered within himself. Also a thing can be related to many other things some of the relations being contrary to others Caius is older than Titus and younger than Sempronia. Anything that can exist or be considered as one thing is positive in contrast to being relative and so not only simple ideas and substances but also modes are positive beings. Their parts are very often relative one to another but the whole considered together as one thing is a positive or absolute thing or idea it produces in us the complex idea of one thing and this idea is in our minds as one picture under one name even though it is an aggregate of different parts. The parts of the idea of a triangle have relations to one another yet the idea of the whole is a positive absolute idea a things triangularity doesnt involve how it relates to anything else. The same may be said of a family a tune etc. Any relation must be between two things considered as two things. . . . Concerning relation in general there are four points to be made. First any single item can be related in an almost innite number of ways to other things. The item in question may be a simple idea a substance a mode a relation 109 Essay II John Locke xxvi Cause and effect etc. It is a remarkable fact that even a relation or a word can stand in relations to other things but I shall not linger on that and shall instead take the example of the many in which a substance can stand to other things. Thus one single man may at once be involved in all these relations and many more father brother son grandfather grandson fatherinlaw soninlaw husband friend enemy subject general judge patron client professor European Englishman islander servant master possessor captain superior inferior bigger less older younger contemporary like unlike and so on almost to innity he being capable of as many relations as there can be ways of considering him together with something else. . . . Secondly although relations arent contained in the real existence of things but are something extraneous and addedon the ideas that relative words stand for are often clearer and more distinct than of the substances to which they belong. The notion we have of a father is a great deal clearer and more distinct than our idea of man. . . . That is because I can often get the notion of a relation from my knowledge of one action or one simple idea whereas to know any substantial being I need an accurate collection of many ideas. . . . Thus having the notion that one laid the egg out of which the other was hatched I have a clear idea of the relation of parent to chick between the two cassowaries in St. Jamess Park although I have only an obscure and imperfect idea of those birds themselves. Thirdly although ever so many relations hold between one thing and another they are all made up of simple ideas of sensation or reectionwhich I think are the whole materials of all our knowledge. To establish this I shall show it of the most considerable relations that we have any notion of and also of some that seem to be the most remote from sense or reection. The seemingly remote ones will be shown also to have their ideas from sense or reection the notions we have of those relations are merely certain simple ideas and so originally derived from sense or reection. Fourthly relation is thinking of one thing along with another so that any word is relative if it necessarily leads the mind to any ideas of qualities other than the ones that are supposed to exist in the thing to which the word is being applied. For example father brother king husband blacker merrier etc. By way of contrast such terms as black merry thoughtful thirsty angry extended are all absolute because they dont signify anything beyond the man to whom they are applied. Having laid down these four premises concerning relation in general I shall now proceed to show through examples how all our ideas of relation however rened or remote from sense they seem to be are made up of nothing but simple ideas. I shall begin with the most comprehensive relation wherein all things that do or can exist are con cerned namely the relation of cause and effect. My next topic is the derivation of this from the two fountains of all our knowledge sensation and reection. 10 Essay II John Locke xxvi Cause and effect etc. Chapter xxvi Cause and effect and other relations 1. As we attend to the changes that things constantly undergo we cant help noticing that various qualities and substances begin to exist and that they come into existence through the operations of other things. From this observa tion we get our ideas of cause and effect. We use the general name cause for whatever produces any simple or complex idea and effect is our name for what is produced. When we nd that applying a certain degree of heat to a piece of wax regularly turns it into a uid we call the simple idea of heat the cause of the uidity and call uidity the effect of the heat. . . . Whatever we consider as conducing to or operating to bring into existence any particular simple idea or substance or mode that didnt before exist we take to be a cause and we label it accordingly. So a cause is what makes some other thingeither simple idea substance or modecome into existence and an effect is what is brought into existence by some other thing. We have no great difculty in grouping the various origins of things into two sorts. First when a thing is made of which no part existed beforee.g. We call this creation. Secondly when a thing is made out of particles all of which already existed although the whole thing of which they are made didnt previously exist. Examples would be a man an egg a rose etc. When this happens with a substance that is produced in the ordinary course of nature by an internal force that works in imperceptible ways having been triggered by some external agent or cause we call it generation. When the cause is external to the thing that comes into existence and the effect is produced by separating or joining parts in ways that we can perceive we call it making all articial things are in this category. When any simple idea is produced that wasnt in that subject before we call it alteration. Thus a man is generated a picture made and either of them may be altered. . . . Things that are made to exist which werent there before are effects and things that operated to produce the existence are causes. In every case the notion of cause and effect arises out of ideas received through sensation or reection and the causeeffect relation however widely applicable it may be at last terminates in simple ideas. For all you need to have the idea of cause and effect is to consider any simple idea or substance as beginning to exist through the operation of something else you dont have to know how it was done. In section 3 Locke remarks that many of our temporal descriptions are really relational though they dont appear to be so on the surface. For example when we say Queen Eliz abeth reigned for fortyve years we are implicitly likening the length of her reign to the time taken by fortyve annual revolutions of the sun. Similarly with all other measures of time. In section 4 not only measured time but also some other temporal descriptions are covertly relational for example old means one thing applied to a dog and another applied to a human being because calling a thing old is comparing its duration with the usual duration of things of that kind. Where we know nothing of the latter as with the sun or a diamond young and old have no Application. In section 5 spatial words such as large and small are 111 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity also covertly relative in the same way as young and old. A large apple is smaller than a small horse. Statements about where things are located are openly relational. So likewise weak and strong are relative comparing the subject with some ideas we have at that time of something having greater or less power. When we say a weak man we mean one who has less strength than men usually have or than men of his size usually have. . . . Similarly when we say Creatures are all weak things we use weak as a relative term signifying the disproportion in power between God and his creatures. An abundance of words in ordinary speechperhaps the majority of themstand only for relations though at rst sight they seem to have no such meaning. For example in the statement The ship has necessary stores necessary and stores are both relative words one having a relation to accomplishing the intended voyage and the other to future use. . . . Chapter xxvii Identity and diversity 1. Another context in which the mind compares things considers things together is their very being when we consider something as existing at a given time and place and compare it with itself existing at another time we are led to form the ideas of identity and diversity. In this context diversity means nonidentity. To say that x is diverse from y is to say only that x is not y. When we see a thingany thing of whatever sortto be in a certain place at a certain time we are sure that it is that very thing and not another thing existing at that time in some other place however alike the two may be in all other respects. And in this consists identity when the ideas to which it is attributed dont vary from what they were at the moment of their former existence that we are comparing with the present. We never ndand cant even conceive oftwo things of the same kind existing in the same place at the same time so we rightly conclude that whatever exists in a certain place at a certain time excludes all others of the same kind and is there itself alone. So when we ask whether a thing is the same or not we are always referring to something that existed at a given time in a given place a thing that at that instant was certainly the same as itself and not the same as anything else. From this it follows that one thing cant have two beginnings of existence because it is impossible for one thing to be in different places at the same time and two things cant have one beginning because it is impossible for two things of the same kind to exist in the same instant at the very same place. Thus what had one beginning is the same thing and what had a different beginning in time and place from that is not the same but diverse. The difculties philosophers have had with this relation of identity have arisen from their not attending carefully to the precise notions of the things to which it is attributed. We have ideas of only three sorts of substances God nite intelligences and bodies. God is without beginning 112 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity eternal unalterable and everywhere and so there can be no doubt concerning his identity. Each nite spirit had its determinate time and place of beginning to exist so its relation to that time and place will always determine its identity for as long as it exists. The same holds for every particle of matter which continues as the same as long as no matter is added to or removed from it. . . . These three sorts of substances as we call them dont exclude one another out of the same place but we cant conceive any of them allowing another of the same kind into its place. If that were to happen the notions and names of identity and diversity would be useless and there would be no way of distinguishing substances or anything else from one another. For example if two bodies could be in the same place at the same time then those two portions of matter would be one and the same whatever their size. Indeed all bodies would be one and the same because allowing two bodies to be in one place at one time allows for all bodies to do so. To suppose this to be possible is to obliterate the distinction between identity and diversity the difference between one and more. . . . That all concerned the identity of substances. There remain modes and relations but because they ultimately depend on substances Locke says they are ultimately terminated in substances the identity and diversity of each particular one of them will be determined in the same way as the identity of particular substances. Questions of identity and diversity dont arise for things whose existence consists in a sequence of events such as the actions of nite beings e.g. Because each of these events perishes the moment it begins they cant exist at different times or in different places as enduring things can and therefore no motion or thought can be the same as any earlier motion or thought. There has been much enquiry after the principle of individuation but what I have said enables us easily to discover what that is it is existence itself which ties a being of a given sort to a particular time and place that cant be shared by any other being of the same kind. This seems easier to conceive in simple substances or modes but if we are careful we can just as easily apply it to compound ones. Consider an atom i.e. For being at that instant what it is and nothing else it is the same and so must continue as long as its existence is continued for so long it will be the same and no other. That sentence is Lockes. Similarly if two or more atoms are joined together into a single mass every one of those atoms will be the same by the foregoing rule. And while they exist united together the mass whose parts they are must be the same mass or the same body however much the parts have been rearranged. But if one atom is removed from the mass or one new one added it is no longer the same mass or the same body. The identity of living creatures depends not on a mass of the same particles but on something else. For in them the variation of large amounts of matter doesnt alter the identity. An oak growing from a sapling to a great tree and then lopped is still the same oak and a colt grown up to be a horse sometimes fat sometimes lean is the same horse throughout all this. In neither case is there the same mass of matter though there truly is the same oak or horse. That is because in these two cases a mass of matter and a living body identity isnt applied to the same thing. How then does an oak differ from a mass of matter The answer seems to me to be this the mass is merely the cohesion of particles of matter anyhow united whereas the 113 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity oak is such a disposition of particles as constitutes the parts of an oak and an organization of those parts that enables the whole to receive and distribute nourishment so as to continue and form the wood bark and leaves etc. Thus something is one plant if it has an organization of parts in one cohering body partaking of one common life and it continues to be the same plant as long as it partakes of the same life even if that life is passed along to new particles of matter vitally united to the living plant in a similar continued organization suitable for that sort of plants. This organization is at any one instant in some one collection of matter which distinguishes it from all others at that instant and what has the identity that makes the same plant is that individual life existing constantly from that mo ment forwards and backwards in the same continuity of imperceptibly succeeding parts united to the living body of the plant. It also makes all the parts of it be parts of the same plant for as long as they exist united in that continued organization that is t to convey that common life to all the parts so united. The identity of lower animals is sufciently like that for anyone to be able to see from what I have said what makes one animal and continues it the same. It can be illustrated by something similar namely the identity of machines. What is a watch Clearly it is nothing but a construction of parts organized to a certain endan end that it can attain when sufcient force is applied to it. If we suppose this machine to be one continued body whose parts were repaired added to or subtracted from by a constant addition or separation of imperceptible parts with one common life it would be very much like the body of an animal with the difference that in an animal the tness of the organization and the motion wherein life consists begin together because the motion comes from within but in a machine the force can be seen to come from outside and is often lacking even when the machine is in order and well tted to receive itfor example when a clock isnt wound up. This also shows what the identity of the same man con sists in namely a participation in the same continued life by constantly eeting particles of matter that are successively vitally united to the same organized body. If you place the identity of man in anything but this youll nd it hard to make an embryo and an adult the same man or a well man and a madman the same man. Your only chance of doing this is by tying same man to same soul but by that standard you will make it possible for Seth Ismael Socrates Pilate St. Augustine and Cesare Borgia to be the same man. If identity of soul alone makes the same man and nothing in the nature of matter rules out an individual spirits being united to different bodies it will be possible that those men with their different characters and living at widely different times may have been the same man That strange way of using the word man is what one is led to by giving it a meaning from which body and shape are excluded. . . . So unity of substance does not constitute all sorts of identity. To conceive and judge correctly about identity we must consider what idea the word it is applied to stands for it is one thing to be the same substance another the same man and a third the same person if person man and substance are names for three different ideas for such as is the idea belonging to that name such must be the identity. If this had been more carefully attended to it might have prevented a great deal of that confusion that often occurs regarding identity and especially personal identity to which 114 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity I now turn after one more section on same man. An animal is a living organized body and consequently the same animal as I have said is the same continued life communicated to different particles of matter as they are successively united to that organized living body. And whatever other denitions are propounded there should be no doubt that the word man as we use it stands for the idea of an animal of a certain form. The timehallowed denition of man as rational animal is wrong. If we should see a creature of our own shape and physical constitution though it had no more reason all its life than a cat or a parrot we would still call him a man and anyone who heard a cat or a parrot talk reason and philosophize would still think it to be a cat or a parrot and would describe it as such. One of these two is a dull irrational man the other a very intelligent rational parrot. Locke then quotes a tediously long travellers tale about encountering a rational parrot. His point is that someone who believes this account will go thinking of this rational animal as a parrot not as a man. With same man in hand let us turn to same person. To nd what personal identity consists in we must consider what person stands for. I think it is a thinking intelligent be ing that has reason and reection and can consider itself as itself the same thinking thing at different times and places. What enables it to think of itself is its consciousness which is inseparable from thinking and it seems to me essential to it. It is impossible for anyone to perceive without perceiving that he perceives. When we see hear smell taste feel meditate or will anything we know that we do so. It is always like that with our present sensations and perceptions. And it is through this that everyone is to himself that which he calls self not raising the question of whether the same self is continued in the same substance. Consciousness always accompanies thinking and makes everyone to be what he calls self and thereby distinguishes himself from all other thinking things in this alone consists personal identity i.e. Given that it is the same person is it the same identical substance Most people would think that it is the same substance if these perceptions with their consciousness always remained present in the mind making the same thinking thing always consciously present and most people would think evidently the same to itself. What seems to make the difcultythat is to make it at least questionable whether the same person must be the same substanceis the following fact. Consciousness is often interrupted by forgetfulness and at no moment of our lives do we have the whole sequence of all our past actions before our eyes in one view even the best memories lose the sight of one part while they are viewing another. Furthermore for the greatest part of our lives we dont reect on our past selves at all because we are intent on our present thoughts or in sound sleep have no thoughts at all or at least none with the consciousness that characterizes our waking thoughts. In all these cases our consciousness is interrupted and we lose the sight of our past selves and so doubts are raised as to whether or not we are the same thinking thing i.e. That may be a reasonable question but it has nothing to do with personal identity. For the latter the question is about what makes the same person and not whether the 115 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity same identical substance always thinks in the same person. Different substances might all partake in a single conscious ness and thereby be united into one person just as different bodies can enter into the same life and thereby be united into one animal whose identity is preserved throughout that change of substances by the unity of the single continued life. What makes a man be himself to himself is sameness of consciousness so personal identity depends entirely on thatwhether the consciousness is tied to one substance throughout or rather is continued in a series of different substances. For as far as any thinking being can repeat the idea of any past action with the same consciousness that he had of it at rst and with the same consciousness he has of his present actions so far is he the same personal self. For it is by the consciousness he has of his present thoughts and actions that he is self to himself now and so will be the same self as far as the same consciousness can extend to actions past or to come. Distance of time doesnt make him two or more persons and nor does change of substance any more than a man is made to be two men by having a long or short sleep or by changing his clothes. Our own bodies give us some kind of evidence for this. All the particles of your body while they are vitally united to a single thinking conscious selfso that you feel when they are touched and are affected by and conscious of good or harm that happens to themare a part of yourself i.e. Thus the limbs of his body are to everyone a part of himself he feels for them and is concerned for them. Cut off a hand and thereby separate it from that consciousness the person had of its heat cold and other states and it is then no longer a part of himself any more than is the remotest material thing. Thus we see the substance of which the personal self consisted at one time may be varied at another without change of personal identity for there is no doubt that it is the same person even though one of its limbs has been cut off. But it is asked Can it be the same person if the substance changes and Can it be different persons if the same substance does the thinking throughout Before I address these questions in sections 13 and 14 theres a preliminary point I want to make. It is that neither question is alive for those who hold that thought is a property of a purely material animal constitution with no immaterial substance being involved. Whether or not they are right about that they obviously conceive personal identity as being preserved in something other than identity of substance just as animal identity is preserved in identity of life not of substance. This pair of questions does present a challenge to those who hold that only immaterial substances can think and that sameness of person requires sameness of immaterial substance. Before they can confront their materialist opponents they have to show why personal identity cant be preserved through a change of immaterial substances just as animal identity is preserved through a change of material substances. Unless they say that what makes the same life and thus the animal identity in lower animals is one immaterial spirit just as according to them one immaterial spirit makes the same person in menand Cartesians at least wont take that way out for fear of making the lower animals thinking things too. As to the rst question If the thinking substance is changed can it be the same person I answer that this can be settled only by those who know what kind of substances they are that think and whether the consciousness of past actions can be transferred from one such substance to an other. Admittedly if the same consciousness were the same 116 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity individual action it couldnt be transferred because in that case bringing a past headache say into ones consciousness would be bringing back that very headache and that is tied to the substance to which it occurred. But a present consciousness of a past event isnt like that. Rather it is a present representation of a past action and we have still to be shown why something cant be represented to the mind as having happened though really it did not. How far the consciousness of past actions is tied to one individual agent so that another cant possibly have it will be hard for us to determine until we know what kind of action it is that cant be done without a reex act of perception accompanying it and how such an action is done by thinking substances who cant think without being conscious of it. In our present state of knowledge it is hard to see how it can be impossible in the nature of things for an intellec tual substance to have represented to it as done by itself something that it never did and was perhaps done by some other agent. . . . Until we have a clearer view of the nature of thinking substances we had better assume that such changes of substance within a single person never do in fact happen basing this on the goodness of God. Having a concern for the happiness or misery of his creatures he wont transfer from one substance to another the consciousness that draws reward or punishment with it. . . . The second question Can it be different persons if the same substance does the thinking throughout seems to me to arise out of the question of whether the following is possible An immaterial being that has been conscious of the events in its past is wholly stripped of all that consciousness losing it beyond the power of ever retrieving it again so that now it as it were opens a new account with a new starting Date having a consciousness that cant reach back beyond this new state. Really the question is whether if this happened it could be the same person who had rst one consciousness and then another with no possibility of communication between them. Locke says that this must be regarded as possible by those who hold preexistence that is who believe in reincarnation. He attacks them thereby attacking the separation of same person from same consciousness and proposes a thought experiment Reect on yourself and conclude that you have in yourself an immaterial spirit that is what thinks in you keeps you the same throughout the constant change of your body and is what you call myself. Now try to suppose also that it is the same soul that was in Nestor or Thersites at the siege of Troy. This isnt obviously absurd for souls as far as we know anything of their nature can go with any portion of matter as well as with any other so the soul or thinking substance that is now yourself may once really have been the soul of someone else such as Thersites or Nestor. But you dont now have any consciousness of any of the actions either of those two so can you conceive yourself as being the same person with either of them Can their actions have anything to do with you Can you attribute those actions to yourself or think of them as yours more than the actions of any other men that ever existed Of course you cant. . . . So we can easily conceive of being the same person at the resurrection though in a body with partly different parts or structure from what one has now as long as the same consciousness stays with the soul that inhabits the body. But the soul alone in the change of bodies would not be accounted enough to make the same manexcept by 117 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity someone who identies the soul with the man. If the soul of a prince carrying with it the consciousness of the princes past life were to enter and inform the body of a cobbler who has been deserted by his own soul everyone sees that he would be the same person as the prince accountable only for the princes actions but who would say it was the same man The body contributes to making the man and in this case I should think everyone would let the body settle the same man question not dissuaded from this by the soul with all its princely thoughts. To everyone but himself he would be the same cobbler the same man. I know that in common parlance same person and same man stand for the same thing and of course everyone will always be free to speak as he pleases giving words what meanings he thinks t and changing them as often as he likes. Still when we want to explore what makes the same spirit man or person we must x the ideas of spirit man or person in our minds and when we have become clear about what we mean by them we shant nd it hard to settle for each of them when it is the same and when not. But although the same immaterial substance or soul does not by itself in all circumstances make the same man it is clear that consciousness unites actionswhether from long ago or from the immediately preceding momentinto the same person. Whatever has the consciousness of present and past actions is the same person to whom they both belong. If my present consciousness that I am now writing were also a consciousness that I saw an overowing of the Thames last winter and that I saw Noahs ark and the ood I couldnt doubt that I who write this now am the same self that saw the Thames overowed last winter and viewed the ood at the general delugeplace that self in what substance you please. I could no more doubt this than I can doubt that I who write this am the same myself now while I write as I was yesterday whether or not I consist of all the same substance material or immaterial. For sameness of substance is irrelevant to sameness of self I am as much involved inand as justly accountable foran action that was done a thousand years ago and is appropriated to me now by this selfconsciousness as I am for what I did a moment ago. Self is that conscious thinking thing that feels or is conscious of pleasure and pain and capable of happiness or misery and so is concerned for itself as far as that consciousness extends. This holds true whatever substance the thinking thing is made up of it doesnt matter whether it is spiritual or material simple or compounded. You must nd that while your little nger is brought under your consciousness it is as much a part of yourself as is your head or your heart. If the nger were amputated and this consciousness went along with it deserting the rest of the body it is evident that the little nger would then be the person the same person and this self would then would have nothing to do with the rest of the body. As with spatial separation so also with temporal something with which the consciousness of this present thinking thing can join itself makes the same person and is one self with it as everyone who reects will perceive. Personal identity is the basis for all the right and justice of reward and punishment. What everyone is concerned for for himself is happiness and miserywith no concern for what becomes of any substance that isnt connected with that consciousness. Locke goes on to apply that to his nger example supposing that the nger takes the original consciousness with it and that the rest of the body acquires a new consciousness. 18 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity 19. This illustrates my thesis that personal identity con sists not in the identity of substance but in the identity of consciousness. If Socrates and the present mayor of Queenborough agree in that they are the same person if Socrates awake doesnt partake of the same consciousness as Socrates sleeping they arent the same person. And to punish Socrates awake for something done by sleeping Socrates without Socrates awake ever being conscious of it would be as unjust as to punish someone for an action of his twin brothers merely because their outsides were so alike that they couldnt be distinguished. It may be objected Suppose I wholly lose the memory of some parts of my life beyond any possibility of retrieving them so that I shall never be conscious of them again arent I still the same person who did those actions had those thoughts that I once was conscious of even though I have now forgotten them To this I answer that we must be careful about what the word I is applied to. This objector is thinking of sameness of the man and calls it I because he assumes that the same man is the same person. But the assumption isnt necessarily correct. If one man could have distinct disconnected consciousnesses at different times that same man would certainly make different persons at different times. That this is what people in general think can be seen in the most solemn declaration of their opinions human laws dont punish the madman for the sane mans actions or the sane man for what the madman did because they treat them as two persons. This is reected in common speech when we say that someone is not himself or is beside himself.Those phrases insinuate that the speaker thinksor that those who coined the phrases thoughtthat the self was changed the selfsame person was no longer in that man. It is still hard to conceive that Socrates the same individual man might be two persons. To help us with this we must consider what is meant by Socrates or the same individual man. There are three options. The same man might be any of these 1 the same individual immaterial thinking substance in short the numericallysame soul and nothing else 2 the same animal without any regard to an immate rial soul 3 the same immaterial spirit united to the same animal. Help yourself On any of these accounts of same man it is impossible for personal identity to consist in anything but consciousness or reach any further than that does. According to 1 a man born of different women and in distant times might still be the same man. Anyone who allows this must also allow that the same man could be two distinct persons. . . . According to 2 and 3 Socrates in this life cannot be the same man as anyone in the afterlife. The only way to do thisallowing for the possibility that Socrates in Athens and Socrates in Limbo are the same manis through an appeal to sameness of consciousness and that amounts to equating human identitysame manwith personal iden tity. But that equation is problematic because it makes it hard to see how the infant Socrates can be the same man as Socrates after the resurrection. There seems to be little agreement about what makes a man and thus about what makes the same individual man but whatever we think about that if we are not to fall into great absurdities we must agree that sameness of person resides in consciousness. You may want to object But isnt a man drunk and sober the same person Why else is he punished for what he does when drunk even if he is never afterwards conscious of 119 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity it He is just as much a single person as a man who walks in his sleep and is answerable while awake for any harm he did in his sleep. Here is my reply to that. Human laws punish both with a justice suitable to the state of knowledge of those who administer the law in these cases they cant distinguish for sure what is real from what is counterfeit and so they dont allow the ignorance in drunkenness or sleep as a plea. Granted punishment is tied to personhood which is tied to consciousness and the drunkard may not be conscious of what he did but the courts justly punish him because his bad actions are proved against him and his lack of consciousness of them cant be proved for him. It may be reasonable to think that on the great day when the secrets of all hearts are laid open nobody will be held accountable for actions of which he knows nothing everybody will receive his sentence with his conscience agreeing with Gods judgment by accusing or excusing him. Nothing but consciousness can unite remote existences into the same person. The identity of substance wont do it. For whatever substance there is and whatever it is like without consciousness there is no person. A substance without consciousness can no more be a person that a carcass can. In the remainder of this section and in section 24 Locke discusses possible cases two persons who take turns in animating one animal body the night man and the day man and one person who alternately animates two different animal bodies. The central emphasis throughout is on the uselessness in these questions of the concept of the same immaterial substance. I agree that on the question of contingent fact the more probable opinion is that this consciousness is tied to and is a state of a single immaterial substance. Please yourself about that. However every thinking being that can experience happiness or misery must grant that there is something himself that he is concerned for and wants to be happy and that this self has existed continuously for a period of time and therefore may exist for months and years to come with no set limit to its duration and thus may be the same self carried by consciousness into the future. It is through this consciousness that he nds himself to be the same self that acted thus and so some years ago and through which he is happy or miserable now. In all these thoughts we place sameness of self in sameness not of substance but of consciousness. Substances might come and go through the duration of such a consciousness and for as long as a substance is in a vital union with the thing containing this consciousness it is a part of that same self. Thus any part of my body while vitally united to that which is conscious in me is a part of myself for example my little nger while it relates to me in such a way that if it is damaged I feel pain but when the vital union is broken what was a part of myself a moment ago is now not so any more than a part of another mans self is a part of me. The rest of the section illustrates and repeats this line of thought. Person I take it is the name for this self. Wherever you nd what you call myself anyone else may say there is the same person. Person is a forensic term a term designed for use in legal proceedings having to do with actions and their merit and so it applies only to active thinking beings that are capable of a law and of happiness and misery. It is only through consciousness that this personality Lockes word extends itself beyond present existence to what is past becoming concerned and accountable the person owns and attributes past actions to itself for the same reason that 120 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity it does the present. All this is founded in a concern for happiness which unavoidably accompanies consciousness something that is conscious of pleasure and pain desires that the self that is conscious should be happy. As for past actions that the self cannot through consciousness square with or join to the present selfit can no more be concerned with them than if they had never been done. To receive pleasure or pain i.e. Suppose a man were punished now for what he had done in another life of which he cannot have any consciousness how does that socalled punishment differ from simply being created miserable. . . . In treating this subject I have considered as perhaps possible some states of affairse.g. But I think they are permissible given our ignorance about the nature of the thinking thing in us which we look on as ourselves. If we knew with regard to this thinking thing what it is or how it is tied to a certain system of eeting animal spirits or whether or not it can perform its operations of think ing and memory outside of a body organized as ours is and whether God has decided that every such spirit or thinking thing shall be united to only one such body with its memory depending on the health of that bodys organs we might see the absurdity of some of the cases I considered. But as we are in the dark about these matters we ordinarily think of the thinking thing or soul of a man as an immate rial substance owing nothing to matter and compatible with any kind of matter and on that basis there cannot from the nature of things be any absurdity in supposing that the same soul might at different times be united to different bodies making one man with each of them for as long as they were united. . . . To conclude any substance that begins to exist must during its existence necessarily be the same any complex of substances that begins to exist must during the existence of its component parts be the same any mode that begins to exist is throughout its existence the same. . . . It appears from this that the difculty or obscurity that people have found in this matter has arisen from the poor use of words rather than from any obscurity in things themselves. For whatever makes the specic idea to which the name is applied if we steadily keep to that idea it will be easy for us to distinguish same and different with no doubts arising. I defend this in the next nal section. Suppose we take a man to be a rational spirit then it is easy to know what is the same man namely the same spiritwhether or not it is embodied. Suppose our idea of a man is a rational spirit vitally united to a body with a certain structure then such a rational spirit will be the same man as long as it is united to such a body though it neednt be the same body throughout. If anyones idea of a man is that of the vital union of parts in a certain shape here structure as long as that vital union and shape remain in a compound body remaining the same except for a turnover in its constituent particles it will be the same man. For the complex idea we use when classifying a thing as being of a certain kind also determines what it is for a thing of that kind to continue in existence. 21 Essay II John Locke xxviii Other relations Chapter xxviii Other relations 1. We can compare or refer things one to another in respect of time place and causality all of which I have discussed. We can also do so in countless other respects of which I shall mention some. First a simple idea here quality that is capable of parts or degrees enables us to compare the things that have it to one another in respect of that simple ideafor example whiter sweeter equally white more sweet etc. These relations depend on the equality and excess of the same simple idea in several subjects and may be called proportional. . . . Secondly we can also relate things or think of one thing in a way that brings in the thought of another in respect of the circumstances of their origin or beginning. Such relations cant change through time so they are as lasting as are the things related. Examples include father and son brothers rst cousins etc.all the blood relationships close and distant and countrymen i.e. I call these natural relations. We can see here how mankind have tted their notions and words to daily needs and not to the truth and extent of things. For the relation of begetter to begotten is exactly the same in other species as in men yet we dont ordinarily say This bull is the grandfather of that calf or Those two pigeons are rst cousins. Locke develops this point remarking that some of our humanrelational terms are needed in the law and notes that cultures differ in this respect. He concludes This makes it easy to guess why in some countries they dont even have a word meaning what horse does for us while in others where they care more about the pedigrees of their horses than about their own they have not only names for particular horses but also words for their various bloodrelationships to one another. Thirdly sometimes things are brought together in a single thought on the basis of moral rights powers or obligations. Thus a general is one who has power to command an army and an army under a general is a collection of armed men obliged to obey one man. A citizen is one who has a right to certain privileges in a given place. Such relations depend on mens wills or on agreement in society so I call them instituted or voluntary. Unlike the natural relations most if not all of these are in some way alterable two people related in such a way may cease to be so while they both continue in existence. These relations like all the others involve relating two things to one another but in many cases the relative nature of the term is overlooked because we have no standard relative name for one of the two subjects of the relation. For example patron and client are easily recognized as relational because they come as a pairif x is ys patron then y is xs clientbut constable and dictator are not because there is no special name for those who are under the command of a dictator or of a constable. . . . Fourthly another sort of relation has to do with whether or not mens voluntary actions conform to some rule in terms of which they are judged. I think this may be called moral relation because it concerns our morally signicant actions. It deserves to be examined thoroughly for there is no part of knowledge where we should be more careful to get xed ideas and to do what we can to avoid obscurity and confusion. It will be my topic throughout the rest of this chapter. 22 Essay II John Locke xxviii Other relations When human actionswith their various ends objects manners and circumstancesare brought under distinct complex ideas these are mixed modes many of them with associated names. Taking gratitude to be a readiness to acknowledge and return kindness received and polygamy to be the having of more than one wife at a time when we form these notions in our minds we have there a couple of settled ideas of mixed modes. But our concern with our actions isnt merely to know what complex ideas apply to them and thus how they should be classied. We have another greater concern which is to know whether the actions thus classied are morally good or bad. Good and evil as I showed in xx.2 and xxi.42 are nothing but pleasure or pain or what procures pleasure or pain for us. So moral good and evil is only the conformity or disagreement of our voluntary actions to some law through which good or evil is drawn on us by the will and power of the lawmaker. Such good or evil pleasure or pain that the lawmaker decrees to follow from our observance or breach of the law is what we call reward or punishment. Of these moral rules or laws on the basis of which men generally judge the moral status of their actions there seem to me to be three sorts with three different enforcements or rewards and punishments. Before listing them in section 7 and discussing them in 810 I defend my assumption that any kind of law does have a system of punishment and reward associated with it. It would be utterly pointless for one thinking being to lay down a rule to govern the actions of another unless he had it in his power to reward compliance and punish deviation from his rule by some good or evil that isnt the natural consequence of the action itself. A natural convenience or inconvenience would operate by itself without help from a law. This association with reward and punishment is if I am not mistaken the true nature of all law properly so called. The laws that men generally relate their actions to in judging whether they are right or wrong seem to me to be these three. The divine law. The civil law. The law of opinion or reputation if I may so call it. By their relation to the rst of these men judge whether their actions are sins or duties by the second whether criminal or innocent and by the third whether virtues or vices. First there is the divine law by which I mean the law that God has set for the actions of men whether announced to them by the light of nature or by the voice of revelation. Nobody is so cloddish as to deny that God has given men a rule by which to govern themselves. He has a right to do it because we are his creatures he has goodness and wisdom to direct our actions to what is best and he has power to enforce it by innitely weighty rewards and punishments in the afterlife. For nobody can take us out of his hands. This is the only true touchstone of moral rectitude and it is by comparing their actions to this law that men judge the most considerable moral good or evil in their actionsthat is judge whether as duties or sins they are likely to procure them happiness or misery from the hands of God. Secondly there is the civil law the rule set by a nation to govern the actions of those who belong to it. Men relate their actions to this also in judging whether or not they are criminal. Nobody ignores civil law because the rewards and punishments that enforce it are ready at hand and are suitable to the power that makes this law That is the force of the commonwealth which is obliged to protect the lives liberties and possessions of those who live according to its law and has the power to take away life liberty or goods from anyone who disobeys that being the punishment of 123 Essay II John Locke xxviii Other relations offences against this law. Thirdly there is the law of opinion or reputation. Virtue and vice are names that are everywhere said and thought to apply to actions on the basis of their being inherently right or wrong and as far as they really are applied in that way they to that extent coincide with the divine law abovementioned. But whatever people say we can see that the names virtue and vice in particular instances of their use throughout the various nations and societies in the world are constantly attributed only to such actions as are in approved of or disapproved of in the country or society concerned. It isnt surprising that men everywhere should call virtuous the actions that they judge to be praiseworthy and call vicious the ones they regard as blameable for otherwise they would condemn themselves by thinking something right without commending it or wrong without blaming it. Thus what people say and think about virtue and vice is measured by the approval or dislike praise or blame which is silently agreed on in a society or tribe or club. When men unite into political societies they hand over to the public the decisions about how their force is to be used so that they cant employ it against any fellowcitizens further than the law of the country directs but they hang onto the power of approving or disapproving of the actions of members of their society and by this approval and dislike they establish amongst themselves what they call virtue and vice. You will agree that this is the common measure of virtue and vice if you consider the fact that although what passes for vice in one country may be counted a virtue or at least not a vice in another yet everywhere virtue and praise go together as do vice and blame. Virtue is everywhere what is thought praiseworthy and nothing but what is publicly esteemed is called virtue. . . . Differences in personal character education fashion interests and so on can bring it about that what is thought praiseworthy in one place is censured in another and so in different societies virtues and vices may sometimes have exchanged places but in the main they have kept the same everywhere. What has kept standards of virtue and vice pretty much the same as one another is what has kept them all pretty much the same as the standards of right and wrong laid down by God. Here is why. Nothing can be more natural than to encourage with esteem and reputation what everyone nds to his advantage and to blame and discountenance the contrary and nothing so directly and visibly advances the general good of mankind in this world as obedience to the laws that God has set for them and nothing breeds such mischief and confusion as the neglect of those laws and so it is no wonder that esteem and discredit virtue and vice should to a large extent coincide with the unchangeable rule of right and wrong that the law of God has established. If people generally went wrong by placing their commendation or blame on the side that didnt really deserve it they would be renouncing all sense and reason and also renouncing their own interests to which they are in fact constantly true. Even men who behave badly bestow their approval in the right places few of them are so depraved that they dont condemn at least in others the faults they themselves are guilty of. . . . You might want to object When you say that the law by which men judge of virtue and vice is nothing but the consent of private men who havent enough authority to make a law you are forgetting your own notion of a law omitting something that according to you is necessary and essential to a law namely a power to enforce it. 24 Essay II John Locke xxviii Other relations I reply that if you imagine that commendation and dis grace dont strongly motivate men to accommodate them selves to the opinions and rules of those with whom they have dealings you cant know much about the nature or history of mankind Most people do govern themselves chiey if not solely by this law of fashion so they do what keeps them in reputation with their peers having little regard for the laws of God or the law of the land. Some menperhaps indeed most menseldom reect seriously on the penalties for breaking Gods laws and amongst those that do many go ahead and break the law anyway entertaining thoughts of future reconciliation with God and making their peace with him for such breaches. As for the punishments due from the laws of the commonwealth men frequently comfort themselves with hopes of impunity. But no man who offends against the fashion and opinion of the society he belongs to and wants to be accepted by can escape the punishment of their censure and dislike. Not one man in ten thousand is stiff and thickskinned enough to bear up under the constant dislike and condemnation of his own social circle. Someone who can content himself to live in constant disgrace and disrepute with his own particular society must have a strange and unusual constitution Many men have sought solitude and been reconciled to it but nobody who thinks at allnobody with the least sense of a man about himcan live in society under the constant dislike and poor opinion of his associates. That is too heavy a burden for humans to bear. . . . We test the goodness of an action by relating it to a rule like testing the quality of gold by rubbing it against a touchstone the outcome of that test determines how we name the action and that name is the sign of what value we attribute to it. Whether we take the rule from the fashion of the country or from the will of a human or divine lawmaker the mind can easily see how a given action relates to it and so it has a notion of moral goodevil which is an actions conformitynonconformity to that rule and therefore is often called moral rectitude. This rule is merely a collection of several simple ideas so that to judge whether an action conforms to it one has only to organize ones thought of it so as to see whether the simple ideas belonging to it correspond to the ones that the law requires. And so we see how moral notions are founded on and come down to the simple ideas we have received from sensation or reection. For example consider the complex idea we signify by the word murder when we have dismantled it and examined all its parts we shall nd them to be a collection of simple ideas derived from reection or sensation. From reection the ideas of willing considering intending in advance malice and also of life perception and selfmotion. From sensation the collection of those simple sensible ideas that are of qualities to be found in a man and of an action through which a man no longer has perception or motioni.e. All these simple ideas are brought together in the meaning of the word murder. When I nd that this collection of simple ideas agrees or disagrees with the esteem of the country I have grown up in and is regarded by most men there as worthy praise or blame I call the action virtuous or vicious accordingly. If I have the will of a supreme invisible lawgiver for my rule then I call the action good or bad sin or duty according to whether I think it has been commanded or forbidden by God. And if I compare the action to the civil law the rule made by the legislative power of the country I call it lawful or unlawful a crime or not a crime. . . . 25 Essay II John Locke xxviii Other relations 15. To conceive morally signicant actions correctly we must look at them in two different ways. First as they are in themselves each made up of a certain collection of qualities represented by simple ideas. Thus drunkenness and lying signify certain collections of simple ideas which I call mixed modes and understood in this way they are just as much positive absolute ideas with nothing relational and so nothing moral about them as are the drinking of a horse and the speaking of a parrot. Secondly our actions are considered as good bad or neither and this is a relational way of looking at them because what makes them regular or irregular good or bad is their conformity to or disagreement with some rule and the comparison with a rule puts them into the category of relation. Thus duellinga positive nonrelational labelis a sin in relation to the law of God valour and virtue according to some laws of fashion and a capital crime according to the laws of some lands. In this case the action has one name duelling taken just as a positive mode and another name sin etc. The positive idea of an action is often expressed in a word that also conveys the actions moral relation so that a single word expresses both the action itself and its moral rightness or wrongness. Locke then warns against assuming that an action that falls under the nonmoral part of such a words meaning must also fall under the moral part. He concludes with an example Taking a madmans sword away from him without authority though it is properly called stealing understood as the nonrelational name of a mixed mode is nevertheless not a sin or transgression in relation to the law of God. In section 17 Locke says that he thinks he has dealt with some of the most considerable kinds of relation and that there is no easy way to classify relations in general because they are so numerous and various. He then announces a nal trio of points. First it is evident that all relations ultimately come down to the simple ideas we have acquired from sensation or reection Locke all relation terminates in and is ultimately founded on those simple ideas. So when we think or meaningfully say anything of a relational kind all we have in our thoughts are some simple ideas or collections of simple ideas compared one with another. Nothing could be more obvious than this in the case of relations of the sort called proportional when a man says Honey is sweeter than wax it is plain that his thoughts terminate in the simple idea sweetness. This is equally true of all the rest of our relational thoughts though often the simple ideas are not taken notice of because the compounds containing them are so complex. When the word father is used its meaning involves the particular species or collective idea signied by the word man the sensible simple ideas signied by the word generation and the effects of generation including all the simple ideas signied by the word child. Locke gives a second examplea partial analysis of the meaning of friend in which the fth ingredient is the idea of good which signies anything that may advance his happiness. This thought terminates at last in particular simple ideas the word good in general can signify any one of these but if it is entirely removed from all simple ideas it signies nothing. . . . 26 Essay II John Locke xxix Clearobscure distinctconfused 19. Secondly in relations we usuallyif not alwayshave as clear a notion of the relation as we have of the things related. . . . If I know what it is for one man to be born of a woman I know what it is for another man to be born of the same woman and so have as clear a notion of brothers as of births. Perhaps clearer For if I believed that his mother dug Titus out of the parsleybed as they used to tell children and thereby became his mother and that afterwards in the same way she dug Caius out of the parsleybed I would have as clear a notion of the relation of brothers between them as if I had all the skill of a midwife. . . . But though the ideas of particular relations can be as clear and distinct in the minds of thoughtful people as those of mixed modes and more determinate than those of substances words expressing relations are often as doubtful and uncertain in their meanings as names of substances or mixed modes and much more than names of simple ideas. That is because a relational word is the mark of a comparison between two thingsan upshot of considering them togetherand this is something that occurs only in mens thoughts it is merely an idea in mens minds and it often happens that men apply a single relational word to different comparisons of things according to their own imaginations which dont always correspond with those of others using the same word. Thirdly in moral relations as I call them I get a true relational thought by comparing the action with the rule whether the rule itself is true or false. Similarly if I measure a thing by a yardstick I know whether the thing is longer or shorter than that supposed yard but whether the yardstick I am using really is exactly a yard long is another question. Even if the rule I am invoking is wrong and I am mistaken in relying on it still I may perceive accurately that the action in question does or that it doesnt conform to it. Chapter xxix Clear and obscure distinct and confused ideas 1. I have shown the origin of our ideas and surveyed their various sorts and I have considered how the simple ones differ from the complex and observed how the complex ones are divided into those of modes substances and relations. All this I think needs to be done by anyone who wants a thorough grasp of how the mind develops in its understanding and knowledge of things. You may think I have spent long enough examining ideas but please let me say a little more about them. The rst point is that some are clear and others obscure some distinct and others confused. The perception of the mind is most aptly explained by words relating to eyesight so we shall best understand what clear and obscure mean as applied to ideas by reecting on what they mean when applied to the objects of sight. Light is what reveals visible objects to us so we describe as obscure anything that isnt placed in a good enough light to reveal in detail its shape and colours. Similarly a simple idea is clear when it is like an idea that one might receive in a wellordered sensation or perception from an object of the kind that it comes from. While the memory retains 127 Essay II John Locke xxix Clearobscure distinctconfused them thus and can produce them to the mind whenever it has occasion to consider them they are clear ideas. In so far as they either lack some of the original exactness or have lost any of their rst freshness and are so to speak faded or tarnished by time to that extent they are obscure. Complex ideas are clear when their constituent simple ideas are clear and the number and order of the simple ideas in the complex one is determinate and certain. The causes of obscurity in simple ideas seem to be either dull senseorgans or weak and eeting impressions made by the objects or else a weakness in the memory which cant retain them in the condition in which they were originally received. Think of the senseorgans or perceptual faculties in terms of sealing wax. Frozen wax is too hard and wont take an impression when the seal is pressed down on it in the usual way the wax that is all right wont take an impression because the seal isnt pressed down hard enough and very warm wax is too soft to retain the impression the seal gives it. In any of these cases the print left by the seal will be obscure. It is presumably clear enough how this applies to the obscurity of ideas. A clear ideaI repeatis one of which the mind has a perception that is as full and evident as it receives from an outward object operating properly on a healthy senseorgan. And a distinct idea is one in which the mind perceives a difference from all other ideas and a confused idea is one that isnt sufciently distinguishable from another idea from which it ought to be different. This rather compressed and difcult account will become clearer in the course of the next two sections. It may be objected If the only way for an idea to be confused is for it to be inadequately distinguishable from another idea from which it should be different it is hard to see how there can be any confused ideas. Whatever an idea is like it cant be different from what the mind perceives it to be and that very perception sufciently distinguishes it from all other ideas for they cant be other ideasthat is different ideaswithout being perceived to be so. So no idea can be indistinguishable from another idea from which it ought to be different unless you mean that it is different from itself for from all other ideas it is obviously different. To remove this difculty and to help us to conceive correctly what the confusion is that ideas are sometimes accused of we should note that things brought under dif ferent names are supposed to be different enough to be distinguished from one another that so each sort can be marked off by its own special name and talked about as need arises separately from anything else. Quite obviously most pairs of different names are supposed to stand for pairs of different things. Now every idea that a man has is visibly what it is and is distinct from all other ideas so what makes it confused is its being such that it may as well be called by a name other than the one it is expressed by. Some things are supposed to fall under one of those names and others under the other but in the sort of case just describedwhere someone has an idea that could go with either namethe difference has been lost. The usual faults that lead to such confusion are I think of the following four kinds. First omission. A complex idea for they are the ones most liable to confusion may be made up of too few simple ideas containing only ideas all of which are common to other things as well in which case the idea leaves out the differences that entitle it to a different name. Thus someone who has an idea of merely a beast with spots has only a confused idea of a leopard because it isnt distinguished from that of a lynx and other sorts of spotted 128 Essay II John Locke xxix Clearobscure distinctconfused beasts. . . . You might want to consider how much the custom of dening words by general terms contributes to making the ideas we try to express by them confused and undetermined. This much is obvious confused ideas bring uncertainty into the use of words and take away the advantages of having distinct names. Secondly jumbling. Another fault that makes our ideas confused occurs when although the particulars that make up a complex idea are numerous enough they are so jumbled that it isnt easy to see whether the idea belongs more properly to the name that is given it than to some other. The best way to understand this kind of confusion is to attend to a sort of pictures usually shown as surprising pieces of art in which the colours as they are laid by the pencil on the page itself mark out very odd and unusual gures with no discernible order in their layout. This sketch made up of parts in which no symmetry or order appears is in itself no more a confused thing than the picture of a cloudy sky. The latter may have as little order of colours or shapes as the former but nobody thinks it a confused picture. Then what makes it be thought of as confused if not its lack of symmetry And that lack plainly doesnt make it confused for a picture that perfectly imitated this one would also lack symmetry etc. I answer that the picture is thought to be confused when it is given a name that isnt discernibly more appropriate to it than some other name. For example when it is said to be the picture of a man or of Caesar then any reasonable person counts it as confused if it cant be seen to t man or Caesar any more than it ts baboon or Pompey. . . . That is how it is with our ideas which are as it were the pictures of things. No one of these mental sketches however its parts are put together can be called confused until it is classied under some ordinary name that cant be seen to t it any more than does some other name whose meaning is agreed to be different. Thirdly wavering. A third defect that frequently qualies our ideas as confused occurs when one of them is uncertain and undetermined. We sometimes see people who use the ordinary words of their language without waiting to learn their precise meaning and change the idea they make this or that term stand for almost as often as they use it. Someone who does this because he isnt sure what to include in and what to exclude from his idea of church or idolatry every time he thinks of either and doesnt hold steady to any one precise combination of ideas that makes it up is said to have a confused idea of idolatry or of the church. The reason for saying this is the same as for speaking of confusion where there is jumbling. It is because a changeable ideaif indeed we can call it one ideacant belong to one name rather than another and so it loses the distinction that distinct names are designed for. What I have said shows how much nameswhich are supposed to be steady signs of things and through their differences to keep different things distinct in our mindsare the occasion for labelling ideas as distinct or confused through the minds secretly and covertly relating its ideas to such names. This may be more fully understood in the light of my treatment of words in Book III. Without bringing in the relation of ideas to distinct names as the signs of distinct things it will be hard to say what a confused idea is. . . . I think that this is the kind of confusion that is special to ideas though even it involves a secret reference to names. Even if there is some other way for ideas to be confused the one I have described is what mostly disorders mens 129 Essay II John Locke xxix Clearobscure distinctconfused thoughts and discourses for what men have in their minds whenever they converse with one another and usually even when they are silently thinking are ideas ranked under names. . . . The way to prevent this is to unite into one complex idea as precisely as possible all those ingredients that differentiate a given idea from others and always to apply the same name to that complex. But this exactness is rather to be wished for than to be expected because it is laborious and requires selfcriticism and it doesnt serve any purpose except the discovery of naked truth which isnt everyones goal And since the loose Application of names to undetermined variable and almost no ideas serves both to cover our own ignorance and to perplex and confound otherswhich counts as learning and superiority in knowledgeit is no wonder that most men should engage in such faults themselves while complaining of it in others. But although I think that much of the confusion to be found in the notions of men could be avoided through care and ingenuity I am far from concluding that it is all wilful. Some ideas are so rich and complex that a the memory doesnt easily retain the very same precise combination of simple ideas under one name b much less are we able constantly to guess what precise complex idea such a name stands for in another mans use of it. From a follows confusion in a mans own reasonings and opinions within himself from b confusion in talking and arguing with others. I shall return to words their defects and misuses in Book III. A complex idea is made up of a collection of different simple ones so that it can be very clear and distinct in one part yet obscure and confused in another. When someone speaks of a chiliahedron or a body with a thousand sides the ideas of the shape may be confused though that of the number is distinct. He can talk about and do proofs concerning that part of his complex idea that depends on the number which may lead him to think that he has a distinct idea of a chiliahedron yet he plainly doesnt have a precise idea of its shape that would enable him to distinguish a chiliahedron by its shape from a gure that has only 999 sides. Unawareness of this problem causes no small error in mens thoughts and confusion in their talk. Section 14 develops this point contrasting two pairs of phys ical things a a sided one and a 999sided one and b a cubic one and a vesided one. We can distinguish the members of a through the different numbers by counting the sides but not by their different shapes whereas we can distinguish the members of b in either way. We often use the word eternity and think we have a pos itive comprehensive idea of it which means that every part of that duration is clearly contained in our idea. Someone who thinks this may indeed have a very clear idea of duration a clear idea of a very great length of duration and a clear idea of the comparison of the latter with a still greater duration. But he cant possibly include in his idea of any duration however great the whole extent of a duration in which he supposes no end so the part of his idea that reaches beyond the bounds of that large duration he represents to his own thoughtsthat is beyond the largest duration that he represents clearlyis very obscure and undetermined. That is why in disputes and reasonings concerning eternity or any other innite we are apt to blunder and to involve ourselves in obvious absurdities. In the long section 16 Locke discusses the attempts one might make to think clearly and positively about innity. This discussion doesnt add any doctrine to what has been 130 Essay II John Locke xxx Real and fantastical ideas said in xvii. All our attempts to think of innite duration or of innitely extended or innitely divisible space he says end up as attempts to think of innite number. When we talk about innite divisibility of body or about innite extension our distinct and clear ideas are only of numbers and after some progress of division the clear distinct ideas of extension are quite lost. As for the idea of innite number Locke dramatizes the inaccessibility he thinks of that by remarking that the attempt to reach it by successive addi tions of 400000000 is no better than trying to reach it by successive additions of 4. Chapter xxx Real and fantastical ideas 1. There are other ways in which ideas can be thought of in relation to things from which they are taken or things they are supposed to represent. These I think yield a trio of distinctions. Ideas may be real or fantastical adequate or inadequate true or false. I shall treat the rst pair in this chapter the second in xxxi and the third in xxxii. By real ideas I mean ones that have a foundation in nature and conform to the real being and existence of things or to their archetypes patterns or models from which they are copied. Fantastical or chimerical ideas are ones that have no foundation in nature and dont conform to that objective reality to which they are tacitly referred as to their archetypes. Let us apply this distinction to the sorts of ideas that I have distinguished. First our simple ideas are all real all agree to the reality of things. That isnt to say that they are all images or representations of what exists for I have shown that this isnt so except with the primary qualities of bodies. But though whiteness and coldness are no more in snow than pain is yet the ideas of whiteness and coldness as well as of pain are effects in us of powers in things outside us they are real ideas in us through which we distinguish the qualities that are really in things themselves. These various appearances were designed by God to be signs enabling us to know and distinguish things that we have to deal with and our ideas can serve that purpose for us by being constant effects rather than exact resemblances of outer things. Their status as real comes from how they dependably correspond with the constitutions of real beings and it doesnt matter whether they correspond as effects or as likenesses. So our simple ideas are all real and true because they answer and agree to the powers of things that produce them in our minds that being all it takes to make them real. . . . Though the mind is wholly passive in respect of its simple ideas it isnt so in respect of its complex ideas.They are combinations of simple ideas that have been assembled and united under one general name and clearly the human mind has a certain freedom in forming them. How can 131 Essay II John Locke xxx Real and fantastical ideas it happen that one mans idea of gold or of justice is different from anothers It can only be because one has included or omitted from his complex idea some simple idea that the other has not. Well then which of these voluntarily constructed complex ideas are real and which merely imaginary combinations What collections agree to the reality of things and what not My answer to that comes in two parts one section each. Second mixed modes and relations have no reality except what they have in the minds of men so all that is required for any such idea to be real is that it be such that there could be something real to which it conformed. These ideas are themselves archetypestheir own archetypes and so there can be no question of their differing from their archetypes and thus from themselves So the only way such an idea can chimerical is by its containing a jumble of inconsistent ideas. Even when a complex idea isnt inconsistent it may be fantastical in a certain sense because someone uses it as a meaning of a word that doesnt ordinarily have that meaninglike using justice to mean what is commonly meant by liberality. But this fantasticalness relates more to propriety of speech than reality of ideas. Consider these two ideas being undisturbed in danger calmly considering what it is best to do and steadily doing it being undisturbed in danger without thinking or doing anything. Each of these is a mixed mode a complex idea of a state of being that could exist. The former of them ts the word courage better than the other which has no commonly accepted name in any known language but there is nothing at all wrong with the latter considered just in itself. Third our complex ideas of substances are all made in reference to things existing outside us and are intended to represent substances as they really are. So such an idea is real only to the extent that it is a compound of simple ideas of qualities that are really united in things without us. On the other side those are fantastical that are made up of collections of simple ideas of qualities that were never really united never found together in any substancesuch as a rational creature consisting of a horses head joined to a body of human shape or a body that is yellow malleable fusible and xed easily volatilized but lighter than common water or a uniform unstructured body that is capable of per ception and voluntary motion. Whether such substances can exist we dont know but we should count the ideas of them as merely imaginary because they dont conform to any pattern existing that we know and consist of collections of ideas of qualities that no substance has ever shown us united together. But they are not as imaginary as the complex ideas that contain in them some inconsistency or contradiction among their parts. 32 Essay II John Locke xxxi Adequate and inadequate ideas Chapter xxxi Adequate and inadequate ideas 1. Of our real ideas some are adequate and some inade quate. I call adequate the ones that perfectly represent the archetypes that the mind supposes them to have been copied from which it intends them to stand for and to which it refers them. Inadequate ideas are ones that only partly or incompletely represent those archetypes to which they are referred. Let us now apply this distinction to each of our three big categories of ideas. First all our simple ideas are adequate. They are nothing but the effects of certain powers in things that are t and ordained by God to produce such sensations in us so they must correspond to and be adequate to those powers and we are sure they agree with the reality of things. If sugar produce in us the ideas of whiteness and sweetness we are sure there is a power in sugar to produce those ideas in our minds or else they couldnt have been produced by it. Thus because each sensation corresponds to the power that operates on our senses the idea so produced is a real idea and not a ction of the mind which has no power to produce any simple idea and it cannot but be adequate since it ought only to correspond to that power. So all simple ideas are adequate. It is true that we often talk inaccurately about the causes of these simple ideas of ours using expressions that suggest that those ideas are real beings in the causally operative things. The res power of producing in us the idea of pain we correctly report by saying that the re is painful to the touch but we handle differently its power to cause in us ideas of light and heat saying that the re itself is bright and is hot as though light and heat were not merely ideas in us but qualities in or of the re. When I speak of things as having secondary qualities please understand me as talking only about those powers. I need to call them qualities in order to t in with common ways of talking for otherwise I wouldnt be well understood. If there were no organs t to receive the impressions re makes on the sight and touch or no mind joined to those organs to receive the ideas of light and heat through those impressions from the re or sun there would be no light or heat in the world any more than there would be pain if there were no creature to feel it even though Mount Aetna amed higher than ever. In contrast solidity extension shape and motion and rest would still be really in the world if there were no sentient being to perceive them. . . . Second our complex ideas of modes being voluntary collections of simple ideas that the mind puts together without reference to any real archetypes or standing patterns existing anywhere have to be adequate ideas. They arent intended to be copies of things really existing we have them only as archetypes made by the mind to serve as standards for classifying and naming things so they cant lack anything. Each of them has the combination of ideas and thus the perfection that the mind intended it to have. Thus by having the idea of a gure with three sides meeting at three angles I have a complete idea that needs nothing more to make it perfect. That the mind is satised with the perfection of this one of its ideas is plain in that it has no thought of how there can be a more complete or perfect idea of triangle than that. Contrast this with our ideas of substances we want them to copy things as they really are and to represent to us that constitution on which all the substances properties depend and we see that our ideas dont reach the intended level of 133 Essay II John Locke xxxi Adequate and inadequate ideas perfection. We nd that they still lack something that we would like them to contain and so they are all inadequate. But mixed modes and relations being archetypes without patterns and so having nothing to represent but themselves must be adequate because everything is adequate to itself Whoever rst put together the idea of danger perceived absence of disorder from fear calm consideration of what was justly to be done and doing it without disturbance or being deterred by the danger of it certainly had in his mind the complex idea made up of that combination and as he intended it to be nothing but what is and to contain only the simple ideas that it has it couldnt fail to be an adequate idea. And by laying this up in his memory with the name courage attached to it he gave himself a standard by which to measure and describe actions according to whether they agreed with it. This idea thus made and laid up as a pattern must necessarily be adequate as it is referred to nothing but itself and takes it origin purely from the will of him who rst made this combination. Section 4 makes the point that a second person may intend to use courage with the same meaningexpressing the same ideaas the rst and yet get it wrong associating the word with some other idea. In that case his idea of courage is inadequate. In this way but in no other any idea of modes can be wrong imperfect or inadequate. And on this account our ideas of mixed modes are more liable to be faulty than any other kind but this has to do with proper speaking rather than with true knowledge. Third I have shown above in xxiii what ideas we have of substances. Now those ideas have in the mind a double reference 1 Sometimes they are referred to a supposed real essence of each species of things. Sometimes they are designed only to be pictures and representations in the mind of existing things containing simple ideas of the qualities we can discover in those things. In each of these respects ideas of substancesthese copies of those originals and archetypesare imperfect and inadequate. I shall explain why for 1 in this section and the next and for 2 in sections 810. Men usually make the names of substances stand for things considered as having certain real essences which are what put them into this or that species. And because names stand for nothing but the ideas in mens minds men must constantly refer their ideas to such real essences as though they were what the idea was meant to represent. It is regarded as a commonplace especially among those who have grown up with the scientic ideas taught in this part of the world that each individual substance has a specic essence which makes it belong to a certain kind. Almost anyone who calls himself a man takes himself to mean that he has the real essence of man. But if you ask what those real essences are men obviously dont know. It follows then that the ideas in their minds purporting to represent unknown real essences must be so far from being adequate that they cant be supposed to be any representation of them at all. But such a complex idea cant be the real essence of any substance for then the properties we discover in that body would depend on that complex idea and be deducible from it and their necessary connection with it be known as all the properties of a triangle depend on and as far as we can discover them are deducible 134 Essay II John Locke xxxi Adequate and inadequate ideas from the complex idea of three lines enclosing a space. But our complex ideas of substances obviously dont contain such ideas on which all the other discoverable qualities of the substance depend. The common idea men have of iron is a body of a certain colour weight and hardness and they also think of iron as malleable but this property has no necessary connection with that complex idea and there is no more reason to think that malleableness depends on that colour etc. Yet it is very common for men to think that what puts things into different sorts is their different real essences unknown as they are. Consider the particular portion of matter that makes the ring I have on my nger most men will unhesitatingly suppose it to have a real essence that makes it gold and from which ow the qualities I nd in it namely its special colour weight hardness fusibility xedness and change of colour upon a slight touch of mercury etc. When I enquire into and Search for the essence from which all these properties supposedly ow it becomes obvious to me that I cant discover it. The furthest I can go is to make this presumption because the portion of matter is nothing but body its real essence or internal constitution on which its other qualities depend must be the shapes sizes and connection of its solid parts. I have no distinct perception of any of this so I can have no idea of that essence. If anyone says that the real essence and internal con stitution on which these properties depend isnt the shape size and arrangement or connection of its solid parts but something else called its particular form this takes me still further away from having any idea of its real essence. Before form came into the story I did have something. For I have an idea of shape size and situation of solid parts in general though I have none of the particular shape size etc. But when I am told that something other than shape size etc. I think that others who examine their own knowledge will nd themselves to be ignorant in the same way. When men apply the word gold to this particular portion of matter on my nger dont they usually mean the word to imply the matters belonging to a particular species of bodies by virtue of its having a real internal essence Yes they do. So for them the word gold must be referred primarily to that essence and so the idea that goes with it must also be referred to that essence and be intended to represent it. But an idea cant represent something of which the ideas owner knows nothing. So those who use the word gold not knowing the real essence of gold have an idea of gold that is inadequate because it doesnt contain that real essence that the mind intends it to. The same applies to all other natural kinds of substance. Setting aside the useless supposition of unknown real essences we can try to copy the substances that exist in the world by putting together the ideas of the sensible qualities that are found coexisting in them. This brings us much nearer to a likeness of them than is achieved by those who think in terms of real specic essences but we still dont arrive at perfectly adequate ideas of the substances in 135 Essay II John Locke xxxi Adequate and inadequate ideas question our ideas dont exactly and fully contain all the qualities that are to be found in their archetypes. That is because those qualities and powers of substances are so many and various that nobodys complex idea contains them all. Men rarely put into their complex idea of any substance all the simple ideas of qualities that they know to exist in that substance. Wanting to make the meanings of their words as clear and manageable as they can they usually put into their specic ideas of the sorts of substance only a few of the simple ideas of qualities that are to be found in them. But these have no special claim to be included while others are left out so that clearly in both these waysthat is in the ideas of sensible qualities that they include as well as in their secret reference to real essencesour ideas of substances are decient and inadequate. It isnt merely that our ideas do omit many of the discoverable qualities of the substance they must do so for the following reason. Except for shape and size in some cases the simple ideas out of which we make our complex ideas of substances are all powers that are also relations to other substances. For example a loadstones magnetic quality is its power to attract iron a owers yellowness is its power to affect our eyesight in a certain way. So we can never be sure that we know all the powers of a body until we have tried out how it can change or be changed by other substances when related to them in various ways. It is impossible to try all of that for any one body much less for all bodies so we cant possibly bring any substance under an adequate idea made up of a collection of all its properties. In sections 910 Locke develops this line of thought empha sizing how numerous the qualities of any kind of substance are and how relatively accidental it is which subset of them get into the meaning of the common name for a kind of substance. He concludes section 10 with this remark about numerousness This wont appear so much a paradox to anyone who thinks about that fairly simple gure the trianglehow much mathematicians have learned about it and how far they still are from knowing all its properties. So all our complex ideas of substances are imperfect and inadequate. The same would hold for mathematical gures if our complex ideas of them had to collectone by onewtheir properties in reference to other gures. In that case how uncertain and imperfect our idea of an ellipse would be containing only a few of its properties In fact though we have in our plain idea the whole essence of that gure from which we discover its other properties and demonstratively see how they ow from it. Thus the mind has three sorts of abstract ideas. First simple ideas which are copies and are certainly adequate. That is because such an idea is intended to express nothing but the power in things to produce in the mind such a sensation or idea so that when that sensation is produced it must be the effect of that power. . . . Secondly the complex ideas of substances are copies too but not perfect ones not adequate. This is very evident to the mind which plainly perceives that whatever collection of simple ideas it makes of any real kind of substance it cant be sure that it matches all the qualities that are in that substance. . . . Furthermore even if we had in our complex idea an exact collection of all the secondary qualities or powers of any substance that wouldnt give us an idea of the essence of that thing. The powers or qualities that are observable by us are not the real essence of that substance they depend on it and ow from it. Besides a man has no idea of substance in general nor knows what substance is in itself. See xxiii.12. 36 Essay II John Locke xxxii True and false ideas 14. Thirdly complex ideas of modes and relations are origi nals and archetypes they arent copies arent made after the pattern of any real existence that the mind intends them to t and exactly to correspond to. Each of these collections of simple ideas that the mind itself puts together contains in it precisely all that the mind intends that it should. . . . The ideas of modes and relations therefore have to be adequate. Chapter xxxii True and false ideas 1. Though true and false are strictly applicable only to propositions ideas are also often described as true or false. What words are not used with great latitude and with some deviation from their strict and proper meanings I think though that when ideas are termed true or false there is still some secret or tacit proposition on which that description is based. Look at particular occasions where ideas are called true or false and youll nd some kind of afrmation or negation at work. Ideas being nothing but bare appearances or perceptions in our minds cant properly and simply in themselves be said to be true or false any more than a single name can be said to be true or false. Indeed both ideas and words may be called true in a metaphysical sense of the word according to which anything that exists is truethat is really is such as it is. Even when something is called true in that sense though there is perhaps a secret reference to our ideas looked on as the standards of that truth. That amounts to a mental proposition though it is usually not taken notice of. But our present topic is not that metaphysical sense of true but rather the more ordinary meanings of true and false. In the ordinary sense then the ideas in our minds are only so many perceptions or appearances there so none of them are false. The idea of a centaur has no more falsehood in it when it appears in our minds than the name centaur has falsehood in it when someone speaks or writes it. Truth or falsehood resides always in some afrmation or negation mental or verbal none of our ideas can be false until the mind passes some judgment on it that is afrms or denies something of it. Whenever the mind refers one of its ideas to something extraneous to it the idea becomes a candidate for being true or false because in such a reference the mind tacitly assumes that the idea ts the external thing. According to whether that assumption is true or false so can the idea itself be described. The most usual cases of this are the following three. First when the mind assumes that one of its ideas matches the idea in other mens minds called by the same common name for example when the mind intends or judges its ideas of justice temperance religion to be the same as what other men give those names to. Secondly when the mind supposes that one of it ideas ts some real existence. Thus the ideas of man and centaur 137 Essay II John Locke xxxii True and false ideas supposed to be the ideas of real substances are true and false respectively one having a conformity to what has really existed the other not. Thirdly when the mind refers an idea to the real constitu tion and essence of a thing on which all the things properties depend. In this way most if not all our ideas of substances are false. . . . . .It is chiey if not only concerning its abstract complex ideas that the mind makes such assumptions. Its natural tendency is towards knowledge and it nds that if it dwelt only on particular things its progress would be very slow and its work endless so it shortens its route to knowledge and makes each perception more comprehensive by binding things into bundles and grouping into sorts so that what knowledge it gets of any of them it may condently extend to all of that sort. This enables it to advance by longer strides towards knowledge which is its great business. . . . When the mind has acquired an idea that it thinks it may be useful in thought or in talk the rst thing it does is to abstract it and then get a name for it and so tuck it away in its storehouse the memory as containing the essence of a sort of things of which that name is always to be the mark. When someone sees a new thing and asks What is it he is only asking what its name is as though the name carried with it the knowledge of the species or of its essence. . . . This abstract idea is something in the mind between the thing that exists and the name that is given to it. The idea is what connects the name with the thing for example what makes ring the right word for the thing around my nger is that 1 word ring is associated with a certain abstract idea and 2 that idea ts or conforms to the thing encircling my nger. So the rightness of our knowledge and the propriety and intelligibleness of our speaking both rely on our ideas. That is why men so freely suppose that the abstract ideas they have in their minds agree to the outer things to which they are referred and are also the ones that commonly go with the names with which they associate them. Without this double conformity of their ideas they would think wrongly about things in themselves and talk unintelligibly about them to others. I shall discuss talk in sections 912 and thought in 1318. First when the truth of our ideas is judged by whether they match the ideas other men have and commonly signify by the same name any of them can be false. But simple ideas are least liable to be mistaken in this way because your senses and daily experience easily satisfy you regarding what the simple ideas are that various common words stand for. There arent many of them and if you do suspect you are wrong about one of them you can easily correct that by going to the objects that involve them. So it seldom happens that anyone goes wrong in his names of simple ideas applying the name red to the idea green for example or the name sweet to the idea bitter. . . . Complex ideas are much more liable to be false in this manner and the complex ideas of mixed modes much more than those of substances. That is because substances and especially ones that have common names in the language in question have some conspicuous sensible qualities that ordinarily serve to distinguish one sort of substance from another and this easily preserves careful users of the lan guage from applying words to sorts of substances to which they dont belong. But with mixed modes we are much more uncertain. It isnt so easy to determine of various actions whether they are to be called justice or cruelty generosity 138 Essay II John Locke xxxii True and false ideas or extravagance. And so by the standard of match with the ideas that other men call by the same name our idea may be false. The idea in our minds that we call justice ought perhaps to have another name. But whether or not our ideas of mixed modes are more liable than any other sort to be different from the idea that other men mark by the same names it is certain at least that this sort of falsehood is much more commonly attributed to our ideas of mixed modes than to any other. When a man is thought to have a false idea of justice or gratitude or glory it is simply because his idea doesnt match the one that is the sign of justice or gratitude or glory in the minds of other men. Here is what I think is the reason for this. An abstract idea of a mixed mode is a precise collection of simple ideas that someone has chosen to put together and so the essence of each sort is a human construct which means that when we want to know whether a given item belongs to a given sort we have nowhere to look except to the relevant abstract idea. And if I want a standard by which to judge what I am saying or thinking about the given item I can only appeal to the abstract ideas of the people who I think use the relevant name with its most proper meaning. That concludes my discussion of the truth and falsehood of our ideas in relation to their names. Secondlypicking up again from the end of section 8as to the truth and falsehood of our ideas in reference not to other peoples ideas but to the real existence of things when that is the standard of their truth the only ones that can be called false are our complex ideas of substances. Simple ideas are merely perceptions that God has tted us to receive and has enabled external objects to produce in us and so their truth consists purely in their being appearances that are suitable to those powers God has placed in external objects.They are thus suitable for if they were not the objects wouldnt produce them. So all such ideas are true. Nor do they fall under the charge of falsity if the mind judges as in most men I believe it does that these ideas are in the things themselves. God in his wisdom has set them as marks to help us to distinguish one thing from another and it makes no difference to the nature of our simple idea or to its doing for us what God meant it to do whether we think that the idea of blue is in the violet itself or in our mind only. Locke goes on to expand this point a little concluding thus The name blue stands for that mark of distinction that is in a violet and that we can discern only through our eyes whatever it ultimately consists in that beingperhaps fortunatelybeyond our capacities to know in detail. Simple ideas wouldnt be convicted of falsity if through the different structure of our senseorgans it happened that one object produced in different mens minds different ideas at the same timefor example if the idea that a violet produced in one mans mind by his eyes were what a marigold produced in another mans and vice versa. This could never be known because one mans mind couldnt pass into another mans body to perceive what appearances were produced by his organs so neither the ideas nor the names would be at all confounded and there would be no falsehood in either. . . . I am nevertheless inclined to think that the sensible ideas produced by any object in different mens minds are usually pretty exactly alike. Many reasons could be offered for this opinion but that is besides my present business so I shant trouble you with them. Anyway the contrary supposition if it could be proved would be 139 Essay II John Locke xxxii True and false ideas of little use either for the improvement of our knowledge or convenience of life so we neednt trouble ourselves to examine it. In sections 1618 Locke repeats with a little more detail what he has said before. 6 simple ideas cant be false because of a wrong relation to external things. 7 Nor can complex ideas of modes be false in that way because they arent supposed to represent external things though they can be false in their relation to common language. 8 ideas of substances can be false in relation to external things either by including a secret reference to a real essence or by aiming to include only ideas of perceptible properties of the substancekind in question but getting the list of them wrong. Though in compliance with the ordinary way of speaking I have shown in what sense and for what reason an idea may be called true or false if we look more closely we nd that in all those cases what is really true or false is some judgment that the mind makes or is supposed to make. Truth and falsehood always involve some afrmation or negation explicit or tacit they are to be found only where signs are joined or separated according to the agreement or disagreement of the things they stand for. The signs we chiey use are either ideas and words with which we make mental and verbal propositions respectively. Truth lies in so joining or separating these representatives according to whether the things they stand for do in themselves agree or disagree and falsehood in the contrary as Ill show more fully later on in IV.v. So any idea that we have in our minds however it relates to external things or to ideas in the minds of other men cant properly be called false because of such a relation. Mistake and falsehood enter the picture in four ways. First there is falsehood when the mind has an idea that it mistakenly judges to be the same as what other men have in their minds and signify by the same name i.e. This kind of error usually concerns mixed modes though other ideas also are liable to it. Secondly falsehood occurs when the mind having a complex idea made up of a collection of simple ones such as nature never puts together judges it to t a species of creatures really existingfor example joining the weight of tin to the colour fusibility and xedness of gold. Thirdly there is falsehood when the mind makes a complex idea that unites some simple ideas of qualities that do really exist together in some sort of thing while omitting others that are inseparable from the rst lot and judges this to be a perfect complete idea of a sort of things which really it is not. For example having joined the ideas of substance yellow malleable most heavy and fusible the mind takes that to be the complete idea of gold when really golds xedness and solubility in aqua regia are as inseparable from those other ideas or qualities as they are from one another. Fourthly the mistake is even greater when I judge that this complex idea contains in it the real essence of some existing body when really it contains only a few of the prop erties that ow from its real essence and constitution. In the rest of this section Locke defends his saying only a few. He remarks yet again on how many properties of triangles ow from the seemingly simple real essence of triangle and concludes I imagine it is the same with substances their real essences are quite small but the properties owing from that internal constitution are endless. 40 Essay II John Locke xxxiii Association of ideas 25. To conclude a man has no notion of anything external to himself except through the idea he has of it in his mind he is free to call the idea whatever he pleases and to make an idea that neither ts the reality of things nor agrees to the idea commonly signied by other peoples words but he cant make a wrong or false idea of a thing that is known to him only through his idea of it. For example when I form an idea of the legs arms and body of a man and join to this a horses head and neck I dont make a false idea of anything because it represents nothing external to me. But when I call it the idea of a man or a Tatar and imagine it to represent some real being without me or to be the same idea that others call by the same name then I may err. That leads to the ideas being called false though really the falsehood lies not in the idea but in the tacit mental proposition attributing to it a t and a resemblance that it doesnt have. . . . In section 26 Locke suggests that the truefalse dichotomy as applied to ideas on the basis of their ttingnottting the patterns to which they are referred might be better expressed in the language of right and wrong. The point is purely verbal. Chapter xxxiii The association of ideas 1. Almost anyone who observes the opinions reasonings and actions of other men will have noticed something that struck him as odd and that really is in itself wild. Everyone is quicksighted enough to spot the least aw of this kind in someone else and to condemn it as unreasonableas long as the aw is different from his own version of it. His own beliefs and conduct may show him to be guilty of something worse of the same general kind but he doesnt see it in himself and hell probably never be convinced that it is there. This aw doesnt come wholly from selflove though that often has a lot to do with it. Men of fair minds not prone to extravagant selfattery are frequently guilty of it and in many cases one hears the arguments of such a man with amazement astonished at the obstinacy of a worthy man who doesnt yield to the evidence of reason even when it is laid before him as clear as daylight. This sort of unreasonableness is usually blamed on education and prejudice and for the most part truly enough but that doesnt get to the bottom of the disease or show distinctly enough what its ultimate source is or where it is located. Upbringing is often rightly assigned as the cause and prejudice is a good general name for the thing itself but you need to dig deeper if you want to trace this sort of madness to the root from which it comes explaining it in a way that will show how this aw originates in sober and rational minds and what it consists in. You will pardon my calling it by so harsh a name as madness when you reect that opposition to reason deserves that name and really is madness and almost everyone has it severely enough to act or argue in some kinds of cases 141 Essay II John Locke xxxiii Association of ideas in ways which if they spread throughout his life would make him a candidate for a madhouse rather than for polite society. I dont mean when he is overpowered by an unruly passion but in the steady calm course of his life. In further defence of this harsh name and the unpleasant accusation that it carries against most of mankind I remark that when in xi.13 I enquired a little in an aside into the nature of madness I found it to have very same cause as the aw I am now speaking of. This struck me as right when I was thinking just about madness without any thought of our present topic. One nal point in defence of the label madness is this. If this aw is a weakness to which all men are liablea taint that so universally infects mankindthe greater should be our care to expose it under its right name motivating people to give greater care to its prevention and cure. Some of our ideas have a natural correspondence and connection with one another and it is reasons business to trace these and to hold the ideas together in the union and correspondence that is based on their individual natures. There is also another connection of ideas arising wholly from chance or custom ideas that have no kinship in themselves come to be so strongly linked in some mens minds that it is very hard to separate them as soon as one comes into the understanding its associate appears too and if more than two are thus united the whole inseparable group show themselves together. This strong tie between ideas that are not allied by nature is created by the mind either by choice or by chance which is why there are different ties in men with different inclinations education interests etc. Custom creates habits of thinking in the understanding as well as of deciding in the will and of movement of the body. The habitual bodily movements at the most basic level seem to be movements of the animal spirits once these are started up they continue in the ways they have been used to and when these have been trodden for long enough they are worn into smooth paths along which the motion becomes easy and seemingly natural. As far as we can understand thinking ideas seem to be produced thus in our mindsthat is produced through the movements of the animal spirits so that the smoothing of paths so to speak explains intellectual as well as be havioural habits. Even if ideas arent produced in that way the notion of a worn path may nevertheless serve to explain their following one another in an habitual sequence once it has been begun as well as it does to explain such motions of the body. A musician who is used to a particular tune will nd that as soon at it begins in his head the ideas of its notes will follow on in due order in his understanding without any care or attention on his part as regularly as his ngers move in the right order over the keys of the organ to play the tune he has begun while his mind is on something else. This example suggests that the motion of the organists animal spirits really is the natural cause of his sequence of ideas of the notes as well as of the regular dancing of his ngers but I shant go into that. In any case this comparison may help us a little to conceive of intellectual habits and of the tying together of ideas. That there are such associations of ideas made by custom in the minds of most men wont I think be questioned by anyone who has attended thoroughly to himself or to others. Most of the sympathies and antipathies that can be seen in men might reasonably be assigned to this cause. The sympathies etc. I say most of the antipathies not all because some of them are truly natural depend on our original constitution and are born with us. But many others are counted natural which would if they had been observed with enough care have been known to arise from unheeded early impressions or from wanton fancies. An adult has a surfeit of honey after which he reacts badlywith nausea etc.to any mention or thought of honey. He knows when this weakness of his began and what caused it. But if it had come from an overdose of honey when he was a child all the same effects would have followed but he wouldnt have recognized its cause and would have regarded the antipathy as natural. My present purposes in this book dont require me to distinguish accurately between natural and acquired antipathies but I have a different reason for mentioning that distinction. It is to issue a warning those who have children or have charge of their upbringing should think it worth their while to watch carefully to prevent the undue connection of ideas in the minds of young people. Early childhood is the time most susceptible to lasting impressions and although discreet people attend to impressions that could harm the health of the body and protect the young against them those that could harm the mind and have their effects in the understanding or the passions have been much less heeded than they deserve. Indeed those relating purely to the understanding have I suspect been wholly overlooked by nearly everyone. A man is harmed by another and thinks about that man and his action over and over and by brooding over them strongly or frequently he cements those two ideas together so as to make them almost one. Whenever he thinks of the man the pain and distress he suffered from him comes into his mind as well so that he hardly distinguishes them and has as much an aversion to the one as to the other. This is how hatreds often spring from slight and innocent occasions and quarrels are propagated and continued in the world. When this combination of ideas is settled and for as long as it lasts reason is powerless to help us and relieve us from the effects of it. For once an idea is in our minds it will operate according to its nature and circumstances and cannot be swerved or dislodged by reason. This lets us see how the following can happen Someone has a recurring emotional pattern that his reason cant overthrow though it is unreasonable and this person listens to his reason in other cases. This disorder is however cured by the passing of time. The death of a child who was the daily delight of his mothers eyes and the joy of her soul rips from her heart the whole comfort of her life and utterly torments her. To use the consolations of reason in this case is as useless as to preach ease to someone on the rack in the hope that rational discourses will allay the pain of his joints being torn apart. There is no way of reasoning the woman out of her tie between the thought of the child and the thought of her loss of pleasure but the two thoughts may be separated by 143 Essay II John Locke xxxiii Association of ideas the passing of time through which the tie is weakened by disuse. In some such people the union between these ideas is never dissolved and they spend their lives in mourning and carry an incurable sorrow to their graves. Sections 1416 add anecdotessome of them quite extraordinaryconcerning associations of ideas. Intellectual habits and defects that come about in this way are just as frequent and as powerful as habits of behaviour and feeling though less notice is taken of them. Let the ideas of being and of matter be strongly joined either by education or by prolonged thought and while they are tied together in a persons mind what thoughts and arguments will he put up concerning unembodied Spirits Because in this persons thought the idea of something real always brings with it the idea of something material he will regard the notion of unembodied Spiritsomething real and immaterialas weird and almost contradictory. Let someone from early childhood associate the idea of God with the idea of shape and what absurdities will he be liable to believe concerning the Deity Let the idea of infallibility be inseparably joined in some ones mind to the idea of some person and the man whose mind has this association will swallow any absurdity that is afrmed by the supposedly infallible personfor example that a single body can be in two places at once. Some such wrong and unnatural combinations of ideas will be found at the root of the irreconcilable opposition between different sects of philosophy and religion for we cant imagine that every follower of a sect deliberately sets himself to reject knowingly truth that is offered by plain reason. Selfinterest is at work here but even it cant bring a whole society of men to such a universal perversity with every single one of them maintaining something that he knows to be false. We must allow that at least some of them do what they all claim to do namely to pursue truth sincerely so there must be something that blinds the understandings of these sectarians not letting them see the falsehood of what they embrace as real truth. What thus puts their reasons in chains and leads men blindfolded away from common sense turns out to be my present topic Some ideas that are not naturally allied to one an other areby upbringing custom and the constant din of the sectso joined in the sectarians minds that they always appear there together and the sectarians can no more separate them in their thoughts than if they were only a single ideawhich is what they treat them as being. This gives sense to jargon demonstration to absurdities and consistency to nonsense It is the foundation of the greatest errors in the world. I almost wrote of all the errors in the world and if it isnt quite as bad as that it does produce the most dangerous errors because when it operates it hinders men from seeing and examining. Locke adds some ne rhetorical ourishes. I have now given an account of the origin sorts and extent of our ideas with several other points concerning these instruments or materials of our knowledge may I call them that. The project on which I embarked requires me now to go on immediately to show how the understanding uses ideas and what knowledge we have through them. In my rst general view of the topic I thought that this was all that would remain to be done at this point. But now that I have reached it I nd that ideas are so closely connected with words and in particular that abstract ideas are so regularly related to general words that it is impossible to speak clearly and distinctly of our knowledge which all 144 Essay II John Locke xxxiii Association of ideas consists in propositions without considering rst the nature use and meanings of language. That therefore is the business of the next Book. 141",

            "In actuality children are born into the world surrounded by bodies that perpetually affect them so as to imprint on their minds a variety of ideas light and colours are busy everywhere as long as the eyes are open sounds and some tangible qualities engage the senses appropriate to them and force an entrance into the mind.",
            "But I think youll agree that if a child were kept in a place where he never saw any colour but black and white till he was a man he would have no ideas of scarlet or greenany more than a person has an idea of the taste of oysters or of pineapples if he has never actually tasted either.",
            "The focussed intensity of the reection is relevant because someone who contemplates the operations of his mind cant help having plain and clear ideas of them he wont have clear and distinct ideas of all the operations of his mind and everything that happens in them unless he turns his thoughts that way and considers them attentively any more than he can have ideas of all the details of a landscape painting or of the parts and motions of a clock if he doesnt look at it and focus his attention on all the parts of it.",
            "Their mental operations are there all the time like oating visions but until the understanding turns inward upon itself reects on them and makes them the objects of its own thoughts they wont make deep enough impressions to leave in the persons mind clear distinct lasting ideas.",

            "The section continues with mockery of people who purport to prove something by assuming it among the premises of their argument and with a reply to a critic who misunderstanding something in the rst edition of the Essay had accused Locke of thinking that when you are asleep your soul doesnt exist.",
            "If the soul thinks in a sleeping man without being conscious of it I ask whether during such thinking the soul has any pleasure or pain or any ability to be happy or miserable I am sure the man does not any more than the bed he lies on has pleasure or pain.",
            "Thus I think every drowsy nod shakes the doctrine of those who teach that the soul is always thinking Anyway those who do at some time sleep without dreaming can never be convinced that their thoughts are for four hours busy without their knowing of it and if they are taken in the very act waked in the middle of those sleeping thoughts they can give no account of it.",
            "Who can imagine that most men for several hours every day of their lives think of something of which they could remember nothing at all even if they were asked in the middle of these thoughts Most men I think pass a great part of their sleep without dreaming.",
            "The soul in such a state of thinking would be little better than a lookingglass which constantly receives a variety of images but retains none of them they disappear and vanish without leaving a trace the lookingglass is never the better for such images nor the soul for such thoughts.",

            "A single sense will often take in different ideas from one object at one timeas when a man sees motion and colour together or the hand feels softness and warmth in a single piece of waxand yet the simple ideas that are thus brought together in a single mind are as perfectly distinct as those that come in by different senses.",
            "If you consider the immensity of this structure and the great variety that is to be found in our little part of it you may be inclined to think that there are somewhere different intelligent beings whose capacities are as unknown to you as are the senses or understanding of a man to a worm shut up in one drawer of a desk.",

            "The senses notice it only in masses of matter that are big enough to cause a sensation in us but once the mind has acquired this idea from such large bodies it traces the idea further and considers it as well as shape in the minutest particle of matter that can exist.",
            "Can we not have the idea of one single body moving without any other immediately taking its place Clearly we can for the idea of motion in one body doesnt include the idea of motion in anotherany more than the idea of squareness in one body includes the idea of squareness in another Im not asking whether in the actual state of the world it is physically possible for one body to move while no others do answering this either way would be taking a side on the debate over whether there is a vacuum.",
            "Indeed we call things hard or soft only in relation to the constitutions of our own bodies we usually 25 Essay II John Locke iv Solidity call a thing hard if it will cause us pain sooner than change its shape by the pressure of any part of our bodies and soft if an easy and unpainful touch by our bodies can make it change its shape.",

            "After receiving ideas from outside the mind looks in upon itself and observes its own dealings with the ideas it already has and that gives it further ideas that are as t to have a role in its thinking as any of those it received from outward things.",
            "For we get the idea of power in two ways by observing in ourselves that we can at pleasure move various parts of our bodies that were at rest and by our constantly observing through our senses the effects that natural bodies can have on one another.",
            "It wont seem so strange to think that these few simple ideas sufce for the quickest thought or largest mental capacity if we consider how many words we can make by putting together various selections from twentyfour letters or if we consider how the mathematicians can get an inexhaustible and truly innite stock of material out of just one of the simple ideas I have mentioned namely number.",
            "Thus the ideas of heat and cold light and darkness white and black motion and rest are equally clear and positive ideas in the mind though perhaps some of the causes pro ducing them are mere privations in the things from which our senses derive those ideas.",
            "As for my point about the idea itself as distinct from its cause I appeal to everyones own experience the shadow of a man consists of nothing but the absence of light but doesnt it cause in an observer as clear and positive an idea as does the man whose shadow it is even though he is bathed in sunshine And the picture of a shadow is a positive thing.",
            "The causes I have here assigned for certain positive ideas are 29 Essay II John Locke viii More about simple ideas privative according to the common opinion and so I have called them but really it is hard to be sure whether there really are any ideas from a privative cause until we have settled whether rest is any more a privation than motion is.",
            "To reveal the nature of our ideas better and to talk about them intelligibly it will be convenient to distinguish them as they are ideas or perceptions in our minds and as they are states of matter in the bodies that cause such perceptions in us.",
            "Thus a snowball having the power to produce in us the ideas of white cold and round the powers to produce those ideas in us as they are in the snowball I call qualities and as they are sensations or perceptions in our understandings I call them ideas.",
            "Clearly there has to be some motion that goes from the object to our senseorgans and from there is continued by our nerves or our animal spirits to the brains or the seat of sensa tion there to produce in our mind the particular ideas 30 Essay II John Locke viii More about simple ideas we have of them.",
            "Since the extension shape number and motion of visible bodies can be seen from a distance it is evident that some bodies that are too small to be seen individually must travel from those bodies across to the eyes and thereby convey to the brain some motion that produces in us these ideas that we have of them.",
            "It is no more impossible to conceive that God should attach such ideas to motions that in no way resemble them than it is that he should attach the idea of pain to the motion of a piece of steel dividing our esh which in no way resembles the pain.",
            "But think about this a re at one distance produces in us the sensation of warmth and when we come closer it produces in us the very different sensation of pain what reason can you give for saying that the idea of warmth that was produced in you by the re is actually in the re without also saying that the idea of pain that the same re produced in you in the same way is in the re Why are whiteness and coldness in snow and pain not when it produces each idea in us and can do so only through the size shape number and motion of its solid parts 17.",
            "This idea of motion represents motion as it really is in the moving manna a circle or square is the same in idea as in existencethe same in the mind as in the mannaand this motion and shape really are in the manna whether or not we notice them.",
            "It would be hard for them to explain why the ideas produced by the eyes and palate should be thought to be really in the manna while those produced by the stomach and guts are not or why the pain and sickness caused by the manna should be thought to be nowhere when they arent felt while the sweetness and whiteness of it should be thought to exist in the manna even when they arent seen or tasted.",
            "Can anyone think that any real alterations are made in the porphyry by the presence or absence of light and that those ideas of whiteness and redness are really in porphyry in the light when it obviously has no colour in the dark The porphyry has at every time a conguration of particles that is apt to produce in us the idea of redness when rays of light rebound from some parts of that hard stone and to produce the idea of whiteness when the rays rebound from some other parts but at no time are whiteness or redness in the stone.",
            "We are now in a position to explain how it can happen that the same water at the same time produces the idea of cold by one hand and of heat by the other whereas the same water couldnt possibly be at once hot and cold if those ideas were really in it.",
            "If we imagine warmth in our hands to be nothing but a certain sort and degree of motion in the minute particles of our nerves or animal spirits we can understand how it is possible for the same water at the same time to produce the sensations of heat in one hand and of cold in the other which shape never does something never feels square to one hand and spherical to the other.",
            "If the sensation of heat and cold is nothing but the increase or lessening of the motion of the minute parts of our bodies caused by the corpuscles of some other body we can easily understand that if motion is greater in one hand than in the other and the two hands come into contact with a body that 32 Essay II John Locke viii More about simple ideas is intermediate between them in temperature the particles in one hand will be slowed down while those of the other will speed up thus causing different sensations.",
            "First the size shape number position and motion or rest of their solid parts those are in them whether or not we perceive them and when they are big enough for us to perceive them they give us our idea of what kind of thing it isas clearly happens with artifacts.",
            "Your own experience will tell you that quite often your mind while intently focussed on some things and on the ideas they involve takes no notice of the effects that other things are having on the organ of hearing although these effects are just like ones that ordinarily produce the idea of sound.",
            "As there are some ideaslike the feelings of hunger and warmththat we can reasonably suppose to be introduced into the minds of children in the womb reecting the ne cessities of their life in that situation so the rst ideas that 34 Essay II John Locke ix Perception are imprinted on them after they are born are the sensible qualities that rst impinge on them.",
            "Faced with some thing that is really a variety of shadow or colour it infers what the shape is takes that variety to be a mark of that shape and forms for itself the perception of a convex gure and a uniform colour although the idea we receive is only a plane variously coloured as is evident in painting.",
            "Suppose a man born blind now adult who has learned how to distinguish by touch between a cube and a sphere of the same metal and about the same size so that he can tell when he handles them which is the cube and which the sphere.",
            "I leave this with you to prompt you to consider how much you owe to experience learning and acquired notions where you have thought you hadnt the least help from them I especially want to include this question here because Mr Molyneux tells me that when the rst edition of my book appeared he proposed this question to various very able men and found hardly any that gave what he thinks is the right answer until he convinced them of it by giving reasons.",
            "Sight which is the most comprehensive of all our senses conveys to our minds the ideas of light and colours which we get only from that sense and it conveys also the very different ideas of space shape and motion the variations in which bring with them changes in the appearances of light and colours and so we become accustomed to judging one by the other.",
            "When this is done with things of which we have frequent experience it is performed so constantly and so quickly that we take an idea formed by our judgment to be a perception of our sensation so that the latter serves only to trigger the former and is hardly noticed in itself.",
            "A good many plants are capable of motion when other bodies are applied to them they briskly alter their shapes and motions which leads to their being called sensitive plants because their movements somewhat resemble those that an animal makes because of some sensation that it has.",
            "I believe that perception occurs to some extent in animals of every sort though it may be that in some animals the inlets that nature provides for receiving sensations are so few and the perception they are received with is so dark and dull that it falls far short of the sharpness and variety of sensation in other animals.",
            "What good would sight and hearing do to a creature that couldnt move itself towards benet or away from harm even if it could see them at a distance And wouldnt keenness of sensation be an inconvenience to an animal that must lie still where chance has once placed it and be washed over by whatever watercold or warm clean or foulthat happens to come its way 14.",
            "The fewer senses any man or other creature has the fewer and duller the impressions are that his senses make and the duller the faculties are that he brings to bear on them the more remote he is from having the sort of knowledge that is to be found in some men.",
            "But our ideas are nothing but actual perceptions in the mind and cease to be anything when they arent perceived so that this storing of ideas in the repository of the memory really means only that the mind has a power in many cases to revive perceptions that it has once had with attached to them the additional perception that it has had them before.",
            "That does the work of thinking and reasoning in children and acts faster than thinking in adults and so it leads both young and old to avoid painful objects doing this with the speed that is necessary for their preservationand settling in the memory a caution for the future.",
            "The section concludes In all these cases ideas in the mind quickly fade and often vanish from the understanding altogether leaving no more signs of themselves than the shadows of clouds do in ying over elds of corn and the mind is as empty of them as if they had never been there.",
            "I shant here go into the question of how far the structure of our bodies and the constitution of our animal 37 Essay II John Locke x Retention spirits are concerned in this and whether the state of the brain makes the difference between good memories and bad so that in some people the memory retains the characters drawn on it like marble in others like sandstone and in others little better than sand.",
            "It may seem probable that the constitution of the body sometimes inuences how well the memory functions since we often nd that a disease can strip the mind of all its ideas and the ames of a fever can within a few days burn down to dust and confusion the images which had seemed to be as lasting as if engraved in marble.",
            "But concerning the ideas themselves as distinct from questions about the efcacy of memory it is easy to see that the ideas that x themselves best in the memory and remain clearest and longest in it are the ones that are oftenest refreshed by a frequent return of the objects or events that produce them.",
            "And so it is that ideas that are of the original qualities of bodies namely solidity extension shape motion and rest and ideas of qualities that almost constantly affect our bodies such as heat and cold and ideas that are applicable to beings of all kind such as existence duration and number which come along with almost every object that affects our senses and every thought that occupies our mindsideas like these are seldom quite lost except by a mind that loses all its ideas.",
            "But sometimes ideas start up of their own accord in our minds and present themselves to the understanding and very often they are aroused and tumbled out of their dark cells into daylight by turbulent and tempestuous passions because our various states bring to our memory ideas that would otherwise have lain quiet and unnoticed.",
            "For example a sound might mechanically cause a certain motion of the animal spirits in the brains of those birds while the tune is actually playing and that motion might be continued on to the muscles of the wings so that the bird is mechanically driven away by certain noises because this tends to its preservation.",
            "I wont go into the question of how far failures in accurately discriminating ideas from one another comes from defects in the organs of sense or lack of sharpness nimbleness or focus in the understanding or the way some people are apt to blunder hastily to conclusions.",
            "Wit lies mostly in nimbly putting one idea together with another idea that it resembles or in some other way goes with thereby making up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the imagination whereas judgment lies quite on the other side carefully separating from one another ideas that differ from one another however slightly so as not to be misled by a similarity into mistaking one thing for another.",
            "I imagine they dont have it any great degree for though they probably have various ideas that are distinct enough yet it seems to me to be the prerogative of human understanding when it has distinguished any pair of ideas well enough to perceive them to be perfectly different and therefore to be two to cast about and consider how and in what respects they can be comparedthat is how they can be related to one another.",
            "I have been credibly informed that a bitch will nurse play with and be fond of young foxes as much as of her puppies and in place of them if only you can get them just once to suckle from her long enough for her milk to go through them.",
            "Such precise naked appearances in the mind without considering how or from where or in company with what others it acquired them the understanding stores away for use as standards it will classify real things into sorts on the basis of their agreement with these patterns or standards.",
            "Thus you observe the same colour today in chalk or snow that you yesterday saw in milk your mind considers that appearance alone makes it a representative of all of that kind and gives it the name whiteness and by that sound you signify the same quality wherever it is imagined or met with.",
            "It is doubtful that nonhuman animals compound their ideas much I am sure that they have no power of abstracting at all and that the having of general ideas is what sharply distinguishes humans from other animals and is an excellence of which the others are in no way capable.",
            "Their having no use or knowledge of general words cant be explained as resulting from their lack of appropriate vocal organs for we nd that many of the lower animals can make such sounds and pronounce words distinctly enough but they never mean anything general by them.",
            "Secondly simple ideas are usually much more clear precise and distinct than complex ones so by observing how the faculties of the mind operate on them we can better grasp how the mind abstracts names compares and employs its other operationsbetter that is than if we also brought in complex ideas with which we are much more liable to make mistakes.",
            "Thirdly these very operations of the mind relating to ideas received from sensations are themselves when reected on another set of ideassome of them simple ideas derived from that other source of our knowledge which I call reection which makes it appropriate to deal with them immediately after the simple ideas of sensation.",
            "I have given a short and I think true account of the rst beginnings of human knowledge where the mind gets its 42 Essay II John Locke xii Complex ideas rst objects from and how it goes about storing those ideas out of which all the knowledge it is capable of is to be made.",
            "If the pictures coming into such a dark room stayed there and lay in order so that they could be found again when needed it would very much resemble the understanding of a man as far as objects of sight and the ideas of them are concerned.",
            "As simple ideas are observed to exist in various combina tions united together so the mind has a power to consider several of them united together as one idea not only in combinations that exist in external objects but also in ones the mind makes up.",
            "The basic raw materials of all its compo sitions are simple ideas received from those two sourcesthe mind has no other way of getting anybut once it has acquired these simple ideas it can by its own power put together the ideas it has making new complex ones that it never received united in that way.",
            "Thus if to the idea of substance we join the simple idea of a certain dull whitish colour and ideas of certain degrees of weight hardness ductility and fusibility we have the idea of lead and a combination of the ideas of a certain shape with mobility thought and reasoning joined to substance makes the ordinary idea of a man.",
            "Ideas of substances also fall into two sorts ideas of single substances as they exist separately for example the idea of a man or of a sheep and ideas of several of those put together such as the idea of an army of men or of a ock of sheep.",
            "Now I shall discuss some of them with a different focus this time it will be on how they relate to ideas that are more compounded looking into the different modications of the same ideamodications that the mind either nds in real things or makes up on its own initiative.",
            "Observing how the boundaries terminate either in straight lines that meet at discernible angles or in crooked lines in which no angles can be perceived and considering these as they relate to one another in all parts of the boundaries of any body or space the mind has the idea that we call shape which presents it with innite variety.",
            "Whereas in simple space we consider the relation of distance between any two bodies or points in our idea of place we consider the relation of distance between some thing and 46 Essay II John Locke Chapter xiii Simple modes of space any two or more points that are considered as staying at the same distance from one another and thus as staying at rest.",
            "The board we also say is in the same place as before if it remains in the same part of the cabin even if the ship has been sailing on and the ship is said to be in the same place if it keeps the same distance from the parts of the neighbouring land even though the earth has rotated.",
            "When we are playing chess it wouldnt suit our purpose to locate the pieces in relation to anything except the squares on the board but quite different standards apply when the chessmen are stored in a bag and someone asks Where is the black king and the right answer is In the captains cabin.",
            "Well then if they mean by body and extension the same as other people do namely body something that is solid and extended whose parts are separable and movable in different ways extension the space that lies between the extremities of those solid cohering parts and which is possessed by them then they are confounding two very different ideas with one another.",
            "Isnt it clear to us all that the idea of space is as 47 Essay II John Locke Chapter xiii Simple modes of space distinct from that of solidity as it is from the idea of scarlet colour Solidity cant exist without extension but neither can scarlet colour exist without extension this doesnt prevent the ideas from being distinct from one another.",
            "If we canas some Cartesians doinfer that mind is different from body from the premise that thinking doesnt include the idea of extension in it we should be able by parity of argument to conclude that space is not body because it doesnt include the idea of solidity in it.",
            "If someone asks as people usually do whether space with no body in it is substance or accident I 48 Essay II John Locke Chapter xiii Simple modes of space answer I dont know and I shant be ashamed to admit my ignorance until the challengers show me a clear distinct idea of substance.",
            "Do they apply it in the same sense Does it stand for the same idea when each of those three sodifferent beings are called substances If it is does it follow that God spirits and body agreeing in the same common nature of substance differ only in having different modications of it comparably with how a tree and a pebble are alike in having the common nature of body and differ only in having different modications of it That would be very hard to swallow.",
            "If instead they say that they apply substance to God nite spirit and matter in three different meanings expressing three different ideas they ought to make known what those distinct ideas are or at least to give them three different names to prevent the confusion and errors that will naturally follow from the promiscuous use of such a suspect term.",
            "Locke is accusing his opponents of some such thought as this In this ball that I hold in my hand there is sphericity rubberiness softness a certain smell and so on that is there are this balls instances of those general properties but there must also be something that has them something that they are properties of.",
            "If only he had thought of this word substance he wouldnt have needed to nd an elephant to support the world and a tortoise to support the elephant the word substance would have met his needs That would have been as good an answer to his question as it is to the question of our European philosophers who ask what supports a things accidents and answers that it is substance.",
            "In section 20 Locke continues his attack on substance ending with this sarcastic jibe against the view that accidents must inhere in a substance If the Latin words inhaerentia and substantia were put into the plain English that trans lates themsticking on and underproppingit would be easier for us to see the very great clearness there is in the doctrine of substance and accidents and show how useful they are in deciding of questions in philosophy.",
            "Well then if a man were placed by God at the edge of the world of bodies could he stretch his hand beyond his body If he could then he would put his arm where there had previously been space without 49 Essay II John Locke Chapter xiii Simple modes of space body and if he spread the ngers of his outstretched hand there would be space between them without body.",
            "If on the other hand he couldnt stretch out his hand that would have to be because of some external obstacle and then I ask whether that obstacle is substance or accident something or nothing When they the Cartesians have settled that they will be able to settle what it is that can be between two bodies at a distance and is not body itself and has no solidity.",
            "Anyway this line of thought about nothing If a body is put in motion and nothing hinders it as would be the case beyond the utmost bounds of all bodies it can continue to move is at least as good as this one If there is nothing between two bodies they must touch one another.",
            "A thoughtful person can no more have the thought of a boundary to space than he can think of a limit to time if anyones idea of eternity is innite so is his idea of immensity either time and space are both nite or they are both innite.",
            "Well then if you allow that God could during such a period of universal rest annihilate the book you are now reading you must also admit the possibility of a vacuum for the space that was lled by the annihilated book would still exist and would be a space without body.",
            "I defy anyone to divide a solid body so as to make it possible for the solid parts to move up and down freely every way within the bounds of that surface without leaving in it an empty space as big as the smallest part into which he has divided the body.",
            "But my topic was the question whether the idea of space or extension is the same as the idea of body and to answer No to this it isnt necessary to prove the real existence of a 50 Essay II John Locke Chapter xiii Simple modes of space vacuum.",
            "By sight and by touch he says the extension of bodies is forced in on us all the time so it has come to dominate the thinking of the Cartesians seducing them into thinking that none of the other properties of bodies could exist in the world except as properties of extended things.",
            "I imagine that men who abstract their thoughts from the words in which they express them and examine well the ideas of their own minds cant differ much in their thinking however much they may puzzle one another with words which they use according to the ways of speaking of the various schools or sects they grew up in.",
            "Though amongst unthinking men who dont scrupulously and carefully examine their own ideas and dont peel them off from the words men use for them but rather confound them with words there is bound to be endless dispute wrangling and jargon especially if they are learned bookish men who are devoted to some sect and have learned to parrot its way of talking.",
            "Reection on these appearances of various ideas one after another in our minds is what provides us with the idea of succession and the distance between any two parts of that sequence or between the appearance of any two ideas in our minds is what we call duration.",
            "We do in fact see that someone who xes his thoughts very intently on one thing not attending much to the sequence of ideas that pass in his mind lets slip out of his account a good part of that duration and thinks the time that has passed is shorter than it really is.",
            "Someone who has in this way acquired the notion or idea of duration can apply it to things that exist while he isnt thinking just as someone who has acquired the idea of extension from bodies through his sight or touch can apply 52 Essay II John Locke xiv Duration and its simple modes it to distances where no body is seen or felt.",
            "Having observed the revolution of days and nights and found the length of their duration to appear regular and constant he can suppose that this revolution went on in the same way while he was sleeping as it did at other times and this will give him a measure of how long he slept.",
            "When we see a thing moving around in a circle in less time than our ideas ordinarily succeed one another in our minds we dont perceive it to move and see it rather as a perfect unbroken circle of that matter or colour and not a part of a circle in motion.",
            "Without a regular motion such as the suns it may be demanded how could it ever be known that such periods were equal I answer that the equality of any other periodic events could be known in the same way that days were known or presumed to be equal at rstnamely through judging them in terms of the contemporaneous series of ideas that had passed in mens minds.",
            "The idea of duration equal to an annual revolution of the sun is as easily applicable in our thoughts to duration where no sun or motion was as the idea of a foot or yard taken from bodies here can be applied in our thoughts to distances beyond the connes of the world where are no bodies at all.",
            "As regards conceivability I am sure that anyone who tries it will easily conceive in his mind the beginning of motion and so may come to a stopa gonofurtherin his consideration of motion but he cant in the same way conceive a beginning of all duration.",
            "Having acquired the idea of succession and duration in the manner I have described and having 55 Essay II John Locke xiv Duration and its simple modes from the revolutions of the sun acquired the ideas of certain lengths of duration we can in our thoughts add such lengths of duration to one another as often as we please and apply the results of that addition to durations past or future.",
            "In both expansion and duration the mind has the common idea of continued lengths capable of greater or less quantities for we have as clear an idea of how an hour differs from a day as we have of how an inch differs from a foot.",
            "It is because we think of both time and spaceor more strictly duration and expansionas states or properties of some being some thing where duration is concerned the thing can be God but we dont think of God as extended and so where space is concerned we are apt to think that it stops where matter stops because beyond the edge of the material world there is no thing for space to be an attribute of.",
            "Then returning to his main thought in this section But be that as it may it is certain that anyone who pursues his own thoughts will nd that they sometimes launch out beyond the extent of body into the innity of space or expansion the idea of which is distinct and separate from body and all other things.",
            "Secondly sometimes time is used in a broader sense and is applied not only to parts of that innite duration that were really distinguished and measured out by periodical motions of bodies that we use as our measures of time but also to other portions of it that we suppose to be equal to certain lengths of measured timethus considering them as bounded and determined even if they were really not so.",
            "Likewise we sometimes speak of place distance or volume in the great emptiness beyond the edge of the world when we pick out in thought an amount of it that could contain a body of any assigned dimensions such as a cubic foot or suppose a point in it at suchandsuch a distance from a given part of the material universe.",
            "Where and When are questions that can be asked about any nite existent and we always answer them in terms for Where of relations to some known parts of this perceptible world and for When of relations to certain periods marked out to us by the motions observable in it.",
            "If the mind could as with number reach the thought of a part of extension or duration that is too small to be divided that would be the indivisible unit or idea by repetition of which the mind would make its more enlarged ideas of extension and duration.",
            "The ideas of length that we have can be turned 58 Essay II John Locke xvi Number in every direction and so make shape and breadth and thickness whereas duration is like the length of one straight line extended ad innitum and not capable of multiplicity variation or shape.",
            "Durationand time which is a part of itis the idea we have of perishing distance of which no two parts exist together but follow each other in sequence and expansion is the idea of lasting distance all of whose parts exist together and are not capable of succession.",
            "He can add one to one and so to two and so go on with his tally taking with him the distinct names belonging to every stage in the progression and so he is capable of all the ideas of numbers for which he has names.",
            "Perhaps not of ideas for which he doesnt have names because the various simple modes of numbers have no variety and cant differ from one another in any way except as more or less so that names or marks for each separate combination seem more necessary than with any other sort of ideas.",
            "In section 7 Locke discusses children who at a time when they have a great deal of intellectual capacity cant count or handle particular numbers in other ways and some adults who through the default of their memories have a lifelong inability to cope with higher numbers.",
            "He concludes To calculate correctly one must do two things 1 distinguish carefully two ideas that differ from one another only by one unit 2 retain in memory the names or marks of the several combinations from a unit up to that numbernot confusedly and at random but in the exact order in which the numbers follow one another.",
            "What else are our ideas of eternity and immensity but the repeated additions of certain ideas of imagined parts of duration and expansion with help from the innity of number in which we can come to no end of addition Regarding that last point Let a man collect into one sum as great a number as he pleases its size doesnt lessen even slightly his power of adding to it or bring him any nearer the end of the inexhaustible stock of number where there still remains as much to be added as if none were taken out.",
            "No doubt we must accept that the great God is incomprehensibly innite but when we apply innite to that rst and supreme being we do it primarily in respect to when and where he exists in the judgment that he exists always and everywhere and we apply innity more guratively I think to his power wisdom and goodness and other attributes which are in their own natures inexhaustible and incomprehensible etc.",
            "Someone who has an idea of some stated length of space nds that he can repeat it going from the idea of one foot say to that of two feet and that by further addition he can go to three feet and so on without ever reaching an end of his addition.",
            "When we reach the utmost extremity of body what do we nd that can put a 62 Essay II John Locke xvii Innity stop and satisfy the mind that it is at the end of space when it perceives that it is notwhen indeed it is satised that body itself can move into it into the space outside the present material boundary Here is why.",
            "Thus wherever the mind places itself by any thought either in among bodies or far away from them it cant nd any end anywhere in this uniform idea of space and so it has to conclude by the very nature and idea of each part of space that space is actually innite.",
            "Other ideas can be as easily and as often re peated in our minds as can those of space and duration but nobody ever thinks of innite sweetness or innite whiteness although we can repeat the idea of sweet or white as frequently as those of a yard or a day.",
            "He concludes Those ideas that dont consist of parts cant be augmented to whatever proportion men please or be stretched beyond what men have received by their senses but space duration and number being capable of increase by repetition leave in the mind an idea of endless room for more.",
            "That is because our idea of innity is an endlessly growing idea while any idea the mind has of a quantity terminates in that very idea which cant be greater than itself so when we try to combine them in the thought of an innite quantity we have to adjust a standing measure to a growing volume.",
            "The former is nothing but a supposed endless progression of the mind over whatever repeated ideas of space it pleases but to have actually in the mind the idea of a space that is innite is to suppose that the mind has already passed over and actually viewed all those repeated ideas of space.",
            "Locke then presents a line of thought like that of section 7 leading to the conclusion that we have a clear and legitimate idea of the innity of numbers but that it is absurd to think that we can have an actual idea of an innite number.",
            "A similarity just as we cant by addition reach the idea of an innitely great space so by division we are unable to reach the idea of an innitely small body because our idea of innity is so to speak a growing or fugitive idea always in a boundless progression stopping nowhere.",
            "An innite idea of space or duration must be made up of innite parts so the thought of its innity must consist in the thought of its having parts whose number can always be further added to it doesnt involve an actual positive idea of an innite number.",
            "Those who want to prove that their idea of innite is positive seem to do it through a ridiculous argument the idea of an end is negative so the idea of innitythe negation of an endis positive Someone who sees that where bodies are concerned an end is just the extremity or surface of the body will not readily grant that the end is a bare negative any more than will someone who sees that the end of his pen is black or white Where duration is concerned an end isnt the bare negation of existence but rather the last moment of it.",
            "Also the people I am arguing against here cant deny that the beginning is the rst instant of being and isnt conceived by anyone to be a bare negation so by their own argument they should admit that the idea of an eternal past or of a duration without a beginning is a negative one.",
            "By thinking about causes and effects they are led to think that we must admit some eternal being and so to consider the reality of that being as matched by their idea of eternity but on the other hand they have no argument driving them to admit the existence of some innite body which indeed they nd absurd and so they rush into concluding that they can 65 Essay II John Locke xvii Innity have no idea of innite space because they can have no idea of innite matter.",
            "Why should we think our idea of innite space requires the real existence of matter to support it when we nd that we have as clear an idea of an innite duration to come as we have of innite duration past In the remainder of this section Locke expands these points somewhat concluding thus If a man had a positive idea of innity whether of duration or of space he could add two innites together making one innite innitely bigger than anotheran absurdity too gross to be worth arguing against.",
            "Until now I have been apt to think that the great and inextricable difculties that perpetually arise in all discussions about innity whether of space duration or divisibility have been sure signs of a defect in our ideas of innitynamely the disproportion between innity itself and how much our narrow minds can take in.",
            "If I have lingered rather long on duration space and number and on what arises from thinking about them namely innity it may be no more than the topic requires for there are few simple ideas whose modes give more exercise to the thoughts of men than those do.",
            "I dont claim to have treated them in their full extent all I need is to show how the mind receives those ideas such as they are from sensation and reection and how even our idea of innityremote as it seems to be from any object of sense or operation of our mindoriginates in sensation and reection as do all our other ideas.",
            "The primary concerns of people have been with one another they have mainly needed efcient ways of thinking and talking about 67 Essay II John Locke xix Modes of thinking their own behaviourincluding the actions performed in specialized trades for which technical terms are coined that the rest of the populace wouldnt understand.",
            "For example the perception that accompanies and is attached to any impression made on the body by an external object gives the mind a distinct idea that we call sensation which is as it were the actual entrance of any idea into the understanding by way of the senses.",
            "If my theme were not conned to the bare ideas of our passions in their dependence on different kinds of pleasure and pain I would remark that our love and hatred of inanimate or unfeeling things is commonly founded on the 69 Essay II John Locke xx Pleasure and pain pleasure and pain we get from using them and encountering them through our senses even if such use destroys them.",
            "These two last envy and anger are not caused simply by pain and pleasure but have other ingredients in them thoughts regarding oneself or otherswhich is why they arent to be found in all men because some men dont have those thoughts of their own merits envy or of intending revenge anger.",
            "But we dont so constantly love what has done us good because pleasure doesnt operate on us as strongly as pain does and because we arent as apt to hope that a gooddoer will bring pleasure again as we are to fear that a baddoer will bring pain again.",
            "I might perhaps have given instances that are simpler than these and dont count as passions such as the pains of hunger and thirst and the pleasure of eating and drinking to remove them the pain of sore eyes and the pleasure of music the pain of quarrelsome uninstructive argument and the pleasure of reasonable conversation with a friend.",
            "The mind being every day informed by the senses of the alteration of the simple ideas that it observes in things outside it and noticing how one comes to an end and another begins to exist reecting also on what passes within itself and ob serving a constant change of its ideas sometimes by the impression of outer objects on the senses and sometimes by its own choice and concluding from what it has so constantly observed to have happened that similar changes will in the future be made in the same things by similar agents and in similar ways considers in one thing the possibility of having any of its simple ideas changed and in another the possibility of making that change and so comes by that idea that we call power.",
            "We shall see that active powers loom large in our complex ideas of natural substances and I shall speak of such substances as having active powers following common assumptions about them even though they may not be such genuinely active powers as our casual thoughts are apt to represent them.",
            "So our idea of power I think being no more relational than any of the others is entitled to a place among the simple ideas and be considered as one of them being one of the ideas that make a principal 72 Essay II John Locke xxi Power ingredient in our complex idea of substances as we shall see later.",
            "In most of them we cant help noticing that there are continual changes in their sensible qualities and indeed a continual turnover in the stuff they are made of and from this we reasonably infer that they go on being liable to similar changes which is to attribute to them a passive power to be thus changed.",
            "We are at least as richly provided with examples of active power which is the more proper meaning of the word power because whatever change we observe the mind must infer an active power somewhere to make that change as well as a passive power a possibility in the thing to undergo the change.",
            "For when the ball obeys the motion of a billiard cue that isnt any action on its part but mere passion and when it hits another ball and sets it in motion it only communicates the motion it had received from something else and loses in itself so much as the second ball received.",
            "Thats all that is involved in the movement of a body that is put into motion its continuing to move after it has been set in motion is no more an action on its part than is its continuing to be at after something has attened it.",
            "The idea of the beginning of motion is one that we get only from reection on what happens in ourselves where we nd by experience that merely by willing somethingmerely by a thought of the mindwe can move parts of our bodies that have been at rest.",
            "This at least seems to me evident We nd in ourselves a power to begin or not begin and to continue or end various actions of our minds and motions of our bodies by a mere thought or preference of the mind in which it commands so to speak that such and such an action be done or that it not be done.",
            "This power that the mind has to order that a given idea be thought about or that it not be thought about or to prefer that a given part of the body move rather than stay still or vice versa is what we call the will.",
            "Perception which is the act of the understanding is of three sorts 1 the perception of ideas in our minds 2 the perception of the meanings of signs 3 the perception of the connection or inconsistency agreement or disagreement that there is between any two of our ideas.",
            "For when we say the will is the commanding and superior faculty of the soul the will is or is not free the will determines the inferior faculties the will follows the dictates of the understanding and so on statements like these can carry a clear and distinct sense for anyone who attends carefully to his own ideas and whose thoughts follow the evidence of things rather than the sound of words.",
            "A third example a man strikes himself or a friend through a convulsive movement of his arm that it isnt in his powerby volition or the direction of his mindto stop or refrain from and nobody thinks he has liberty in this everyone sympathizes with him as acting by necessity and constraint.",
            "A fourth example a man is carried while fast asleep into a room where there is a person he has been longing to see and speak with and he is there locked in securely when he awakes he is glad to nd himself in such desirable company which he stays in willingly preferring his staying to his going away.",
            "But whether he turns his thoughts from one idea to another is often within his choice and then he is as much at liberty in respect of his ideas as he is in respect of bodies he stands on in each case he can move from one to another as he pleases.",
            "A man on the rack isnt at liberty to set aside the idea of pain and distract himself with other thoughts and sometimes a boisterous passion hurries our thoughts along as a hurricane does our bodies without leaving us free to think about other things that we would rather choose.",
            "If an agent has thought and is capable of volition but starts or continues some action that is contrary to the preference of his mind that is called compulsion if he stops or restricts an action when this is contrary to his volition this is called restraint.",
            "It follows from what I have said that the question itself is as improper and meaningless as Is mans sleep swift or not and Is mans virtue square or not because liberty no more applies to the will than speed does to sleep or squareness to virtue.",
            "A man would prefer ying to walking yet who can say he ever wills himself to y Clearly volition is an act of the mind knowingly exerting that control it takes itself to have over any part of the man so that we cant will ourselves to y because we know that we cant do so.",
            "Plainly the will is simply one power or ability and freedom is another so that to ask whether the will has freedom is to ask whether one power has another power whether one ability has another abilitya question too obviously and grossly absurd to argue about or to need an answer.",
            "For anyone can see that powers belong only to agents and are attributes only of substances and not of powers themselves So that the question Is the will free contains the question Is the will a substance an agent since freedom can properly be attributed only to acting substances.",
            "If it were reasonable to think and talk of faculties as distinct beings that can act The will orders The will is free it would also be all right to have a speaking faculty a walking faculty and a dancing faculty and to think and talk of these as producing the relevant actionsThe singing faculty sings The dancing faculty dances.",
            "And when we say such things as that the will directs the understanding or the understanding obeys or disobeys the will this is no more correct and intelligible than to say that the power of speaking directs the power of singing or the power of singing obeys or disobeys the power of speaking.",
            "To return now to the enquiry about liberty I think the proper question is not Is the will free but Is a man free There are two ways of taking the former question I shall deal with one in the remainder of this section and the other in sections 224.",
            "How can we think anyone freer than to have the power to do what he will He concludes So that in respect of actions within the reach of such a power in him a man seems as free as it is possible for freedom to make him.",
            "In sections 234 Locke presents one basic point If at some time you have in your mind the question of whether to start walking right now and you do have the power to start walking and also the power not to do so you cannot be free with respect to the relevant act of volition.",
            "Either you will start walking or you wont whichever it is will be an upshot of your choosing to walk or choosing not to so you cannot get out of making an act of the will settling the matter and so your act of the will is not free.",
            "If the ideas of liberty and volition were well xed in our 77 Essay II John Locke xxi Power understandings and if we kept them in our minds through all the questions that are raised about liberty and volition it would be easier I think to resolve most of the difculties that perplex mens thoughts and entangle their understandings because it would be easier for us to see where the obscurity arose from the nature of the thing under discussion and where it arose merely from the confused meanings of some words.",
            "When walking or speaking are proposed to the mind sitting still and staying silent are mere nonactions but they need the determination of the will as much as walking and speaking do and they are often as weighty in their consequences as the other two the real actions.",
            "If you arent satised with this answer then you must be asking What determines the will with the meaning What moves the mind in every particular instance to perform the particular act of volition that it does perform This is an intelligible and respectable question which doesnt involve treating the will as an agent or anything like that.",
            "To return then to the question What determines the will in regard to our actions I used to accept the widespread opinionto which I shall return in section 35that what determines the will is the greater good in view but I now think that what does it is some uneasiness that the man is at present under.",
            "For desire being an uneasiness in the lack of an absent good in the case of pain the absent good is ease freedom from the pain and until ease is attained we can call the uneasiness desire for nobody feels pain without wanting to be eased of it with a desire equal in intensity to that pain.",
            "It is true that good and evil present and absent work on the mind but what immediately determines the will to each voluntary action is the uneasiness of desire xed on some absent goodwhether the good be negative such as the absence of pain or positive such as pleasure.",
            "And so we see that our Allwise Maker has put into us the uneasiness of hunger and thirst and other natural desires which return at the proper time and 79 Essay II John Locke xxi Power determine our wills for the preservation of ourselves and the continuation of our species.",
            "If the mere thought of those good ends had been sufcient to determine the will and set us to work it is reasonable to think we would then have had none of these natural pains and perhaps in this world little or no pain at all.",
            "But when I looked harder into the matter I was forced to conclude that even what a person knows to be the greater good doesnt determine his will until his desire has been correspondingly raised and has made him uneasy in his lack of the good in question.",
            "Locke gives the example of a poor man who agrees that afuence is better than poverty but who isnt uneasy over his poverty and therefore doesnt bestir himself to get rich and the example of a man who knows that virtue brings advantages but who does nothing about it because he doesnt hunger and thirst after righteousness.",
            "He writes colourfully of the alcoholic whose knowledge of what would be better for him leads him frequently to resolve to give up drinking but doesnt lead him actually to give it up because the uneasiness to miss his accustomed delight returns the acknowledged greater good loses its hold and the present uneasiness determines his will to start drinking again.",
            "Experience makes it evident that uneasiness alone operates on the will but why is this so In answering this I shall assume that whenever volition occurs there is some uneasiness the question being why it and not something else acts immediately on the will in every case.",
            "The reason for that is that while we are in a state of uneasiness we cant sense ourselves as being happy or on the way to happiness because everyone nds that pain and uneasiness are inconsistent with happiness spoiling the savour even of the good things that we do have.",
            "The idea of it may indeed be 80 Essay II John Locke xxi Power in the mind and viewed as present there but for something that is in the mind in that way to counterbalance the removal of an uneasiness that we have it must raise our desire to a point where the uneasiness of that prevails over the other uneasiness in determining the will.",
            "Now because pleasure and pain are produced in us by the oper ation of certain objects on our minds or our bodies and in different degrees anything that is apt to produce pleasure in us we call good and what is apt to produce pain we call bad just because it is apt to produce in us the pleasure or pain that constitutes our happiness or misery.",
            "Now let one man place his satisfaction in sensual pleasures another in the delight of knowledge each admits there is great pleasure in what the other pursues yet neither makes the thing that delights the other a part of his happiness and their desires are not moved that way.",
            "Something that each of us can observe in himself is this although the greater visible good doesnt always raise a mans desires in proportion to the greatness he acknowledges it to have every little trouble moves us and sets us to work to get rid of it.",
            "So when we are free of all uneasiness a moderate portion of good is enough to keep us content in the present and a fairly 82 Essay II John Locke xxi Power low level of pleasure in a series of ordinary enjoyments adds up to a happiness with which most of us can be satised.",
            "If this were not so thered be no room for the obviously trivial actions that we so often exercise our wills on voluntarily spending much of our lives on thema pattern of conduct that couldnt persist if our will or desire were constantly directed towards the greatest apparent good.",
            "In this life indeed most people who are happy to the extent of having a constant series of moderate pleasures with no admixture of uneasiness would be content to continue in this life for ever even though they cant deny that there may be a state of eternal durable joys in an afterlife far surpassing all the good that is to be found in this one.",
            "And yet with a clear view of this difference satised of the possibility of a perfect secure and lasting happiness in a future state and quite sure that it is not to be had in this life while they limit their happiness to some little enjoyment and exclude the joys of heaven from making a necessary part of it still their desires are not moved by this greater apparent good nor are their wills determined to any action or effort towards its attainment.",
            "In section 45 Locke discusses at length the phenomenon of people not being moved to seek what they believe are very great longterm goods because their wills are activated by little present uneasinesses aimed at smaller goods that they think of as necessary for their happiness.",
            "When we are in pain misery uneasiness Locke says the rst thing we need in order to become happy is to get out of that state and in that situation the absence of absent good does not contribute to our unhappiness and so the thought of absent goodeven if we have it and admit that the item in question would be goodis pushed aside to make way for the removal of the uneasinesses that we feel.",
            "In this lies mans liberty and all the mistakes errors and faults that we run into in living our lives and pursuing happiness arise from not availing ourselves of this liberty and instead rushing into the determination of our wills going into action before thinking enough about what we are aiming at.",
            "When we exercise it and then act we have done our duty all that we can or ought to do in pursuit of our happiness and it isnt a fault but a perfection of our nature to desire will and act according to the last result of a fair examination.",
            "This is so far from conning or weakening our freedom that it is the very essence of it it doesnt cut short our liberty but brings it to its proper goal and the further we are removed from such a determinationthat is from being made to act by the judgments we have made and the uneasinesses that result from themthe nearer we are to misery and slavery.",
            "A man is at liberty to lift his hand to his head or let it rest in his lap he is perfectly indifferent as between these and it would be an imperfection in him if he lacked that powerthat is if he were unable to lift his hand or unable not to lift it given that no desire of his selects one course of action rather than the other.",
            "If we think about those superior beings above us who enjoy perfect happinessthat is the angels in heavenwe shall have reason to judge that they are more steadily determined in their choice of good than we are and yet we have no reason to think they are less happy or less free.",
            "And if such poor nite creatures as us were entitled to say anything about what innite wisdom and goodness could do I think we might say that God himself cannot choose what is not good his freedom does not prevent his being determined by what is best.",
            "Would anyone choose to be an imbecile so as to be less determined by wise thoughts than a wise man Is it worth the name of freedom to be at liberty to play the fool and draw shame and misery upon oneself Breaking loose from the conduct of reason and lacking that restraint of examination and judgment that keeps us from choosing or doing the worseif that is liberty true liberty then madmen and fools are the only free men Anyone who chose to be mad for the sake of such liberty would have to be mad already.",
            "Someone who has his chains knocked off and the prison doors opened for him is perfectly at liberty because he can either go or stay as he chooses even if his preference is determined to stay because of the darkness of the night the badness of the weather or his lack of anywhere else to sleep.",
            "The liberty of thinking beings in their constant pursuit of true happiness turns on the hinge of their ability in particular cases to suspend this pursuit until they have looked forward in time and informed themselves about whether the particular thing they want and are considering pursuing really does lie on the way to their main end really does make a part of the happiness that is their greatest good.",
            "Whatever necessity requires us to pursue real happiness the same necessity with the same force requires us to suspend action to deliberate and to look carefully at each successive desire with a view to discovering whether the satisfaction of itrather than promoting our happinesswont interfere with our true happiness and lead us away from it.",
            "This it seems to me is the great privilege of nite thinking beings and I ask you to think hard about whether the following isnt true The course of mens behaviour depends on what use they make of their ability to suspend their desires and stop them from determining their wills to any action until they have examined the good and evil of the contemplated action fairly and with as much care as its importance merits.",
            "If we were concerned only with how things go in this life the explanation of why one man devotes himself to study and knowledge and another to hawking and hunting why one chooses luxury and debauchery and another sobriety and riches would not be because some of these didnt aim at their own happiness but because different things make them happy.",
            "So the physician was right in what he said to his patient who had sore eyes If you get more pleasure from the taste of wine than from the use of your sight wine is good for you but if the pleasure of seeing is greater to you than that of drinking wine is bad.",
            "As pleasant tastes depend not on the things themselves but on how they suit this or that partic ular palate and palates vary greatly so also the greatest happiness consists in having the things that produce the greatest pleasure and not having any that cause disturbance or pain.",
            "So if men have nothing to hope for in an afterlife if this is the only life in which they can enjoy anything it is neither strange nor unreasonable that they should seek their happiness by avoiding all the things that disease them here and pursuing all that delight them hereand its not surprising that there should be much variety and difference among these.",
            "It can happen that men choose different things and they all choose rightlyif we suppose them to have no prospect of an afterlife which involves supposing them to be merely like a crowd of poor insectssome of them bees delighting in owers and their sweetness others beetles enjoying other kinds of foodall of them able to enjoy themselves for a season after which they go out of existence for ever.",
            "This much in undeniable but it seems to 86 Essay II John Locke xxi Power cover only the actions of a man resulting from his volition so there remains the question Is he at liberty to will or not In sections 234 I have answered that in most cases a man isnt at liberty to refrain from the act of volition he must exert an act of his will through which the proposed action is done or one through which it is not done.",
            "His will is always determined by whatever is judged good by his understanding but that doesnt excuse him if by a too hasty choice of his own making he has adopted wrong measures of good and eviljudgments which however false they are have the same inuence on all his future conduct as if they were true.",
            "But since men are always constant and in earnest about happiness and misery the question still remains How do men come to prefer the worse to the better and to choose what they admit has made them miserable In section 57 Locke sketches an answer to his question.",
            "In this life we are accustomed to having a narrow range in which we enjoy only one pleasure at a time and when we have such a single pleasure and have no uneasiness the pleasure is enough to make us think we are happy and we arent affected by all remote good even when we are aware of it.",
            "While they think that the joys of a future state dont move them they have little concern or uneasiness and the will free from the determination of such desires for distantfuture goods is left to pursue nearer satisfactions removing those uneasinesses that it feels from its lack of them and its longing for them.",
            "The section concludes For someone whounlike a bee or a beetlehas a prospect of the different state that awaits all men after this life a state of perfect happiness or of misery depending on their behaviour here the measures of good and evil that govern his choice are utterly changed.",
            "For no pleasure or pain in this life can be remotely comparable to the endless happiness or intense misery of an immortal soul in the afterlife so his choices about how to act will depend not on the passing pleasure or pain that accompanies or follows them here but on whether they serve to secure that perfect durable happiness hereafter.",
            "But things that draw pleasure and pain after them are also considered as good and bad because our desiresthose of any creature with foresightaim not only at present pleasure and pain but also at whatever is apt to cause pleasure or pain for us at a later time.",
            "In section 65 Locke makes the point that in our judgments about possible future pleasure of a sort we are unacquainted with we are apt if that pleasure is in competition with something that is closer in time to underestimate the former on the ground that if we actually had it we would nd that it didnt live up to its billing.",
            "Judging is like balancing an account to see whether there is prot or loss so if either column is added up in a rush resulting in the omission of some gures that ought to be included this haste causes as wrong a judgment as if it were perfect ignorance.",
            "If a man sees what would do him good or harm make him happy or miserable without being able to move one step towards or from it what good is it to him that he sees it And if someone is at liberty to ramble in perfect darkness how is his liberty any better than if he were driven up and down as a bubble by the force of the wind Being acted on by a blind impulse from within oneself is no better than being acted on by one from outside.",
            "So the rst great use of liberty is to hinder blind headlong rushing the principal exercise of freedom is to stand still open the eyes look around and take a view of the consequences of what we are going to dodoing all this with as much thoroughness as the weight of the matter requires.",
            "All men desire happiness thats past doubt but when they are rid of pain they are apt to settle for any pleasure that is readily available or that they have grown to be fond of and to be satised with that and thus to be happy until some new desire disturbs that happiness and shows them that they are not happy.",
            "We are encouraged to think that some good would not contribute to our happiness by the real or supposed unpleasantness of the actions needed to achieve it for we tend to nd it so absurd that we should make ourselves unhappy in order to achieve happiness that we dont easily bring ourselves to it.",
            "Exquisite and endless happiness is a possible consequence of a good life here and the contrary state the possible reward of a bad one and someone who accepts this must admit that his judgment is wrong if he doesnt conclude that a virtuous life which may bring the certain expectation of everlasting bliss is to be preferred to a vicious one with the fear of that dreadful state of misery that may overtake the guilty or at best the terrible uncertain hope of annihilation.",
            "I have said nothing about the certainty or probability of a future state because I have wanted to show the wrong judgment that anyone must admit that he is makingon his own principlesif he prefers the short pleasures of a vicious life while he is certain that an afterlife is at least possible.",
            "Rather it is an indifference of his operative powers they are equally able to operate and to refrain from operating now after the wills decree just as they were before it if you want to call this indifference do so This indifference gives a man a kind of freedom for example I have the ability to move my hand or to let it rest that operative power is indifferent as between moving and not moving I am then in that respect perfectly free.",
            "My will determines that operative power to keep my hand still but I am free because my operative power remains indifferent as between moving and not moving my will has ordered the keepingstill of my hand but the power to move it hasnt been lost or even lessened that powers indifference as between moving and not moving is just as it was before the will commanded as can be seen if the will puts it to the trial by ordering that my hand move.",
            "On the other hand when I turn my eyes another way or move my body out of the sunbeams I 92 Essay II John Locke xxii Mixed modes am genuinely active because I put myself into that motion of my own choice by a power within myself.",
            "For I think that these would sufce to explain the nature of colours sounds tastes smells and all our other ideas if only we had faculties acute enough to perceive the textures and movements of the minute bodies that produce in us those sensations of colour taste and so on.",
            "For my purposes it is enough to note that gold or saffron has a power to produce in us the idea of yellow and snow or milk the idea of white which we can only have by our sight I neednt explore the physics of what gives them those powers.",
            "Though Ill say just this about the causes of those powers when we go beyond the bare ideas in our minds and start to think about their causes we cant conceive anything in a sensible object through which it could produce different ideas in us except the sizes shapes numbers textures and motions of its imperceptible parts.",
            "These mixed modes are distinguished from the complex ideas of substances by the fact that they are not looked upon to be typical marks of any real beings that have a steady existence and are only 93 Essay II John Locke xxii Mixed modes scattered and independent ideas put together by the mind.",
            "The man who rst formed the idea of hypocrisy might either have taken it at rst from observing someone who made a show of good qualities that he didnt really have or else have formed that idea in his mind without having any such pattern to fashion it by.",
            "I answer that the idea gets its unity from the minds act of combining those simple ideas and considering them as one complex idea of which those are the parts and the giving of a name to the complex idea is generally viewed as the nal stage in the process of combination.",
            "The purpose of language is for men to show their thoughts or to communicate them to one another as quickly as possible so men usually make and name the complex modes for which they have frequent use in everyday life and conversation and ones that they seldom have occasion to mention they leave loose without names to tie them together.",
            "He then returns to his main theme If you want to see how many different ideas are in this way wrapped up in one short sound and how much of our time and breath is thereby saved try to list all the simple ideas that are involved in the meaning of reprieve or appeal 8.",
            "Mixed modes are eeting and transient combinations of simple ideas they have a short existence everywhere except in the minds of men and even there they exist only while they are thought of their greatest permanency is in their names which are therefore apt to be taken for the ideas themselves.",
            "Action is the great business of mankind and the 95 Essay II John Locke xxii Mixed modes whole subjectmatter of all laws so it is no wonder that all sorts of modes of thinking and motion should be attended to their ideas observed and laid up in the memory and names assigned to them.",
            "Summing up Let us examine any modes of action for example consideration and assent which are actions of the mind running and speaking which are actions of the body revenge and murder which are actions of both to gether and we shall nd them to be merely collections of simple ideas that together make up the complex ideas signied by those names.",
            "Power is the source of all action and the substances that have the powers when they exert a power to produce an act are called causes and what comes about by the exerting of that powera substance that is produced or simple ideas that are introduced into any subjectare called effects.",
            "If there is any kind of action other than these I have no notion or idea of it and so it is far from my thoughts apprehensions and knowledge and I am as much in the dark about it as I am about ve extra senses or as a blind man is about colours.",
            "Similarly when a peasant says Cold freezes water although the word freeze seems to import some specic kind of action all it really means in the mouth of the peasant is that water that was uid has become hard implying no idea of the action through which this is done.",
            "Sometimes it notices that a certain number of these simple ideas go constantly together and it presumes them to belong to one thing andbecause words are suited to ordinary ways of thinking and are used for speed and conveniencethose ideas when united in one subject are called by one name.",
            "If anyone were asked What is the subject in which colour or weight inheres he would have to reply In the solid extended parts and if he were asked What does that solidity and extension inhere in he wouldnt be in a much better position than the Indian philosopher who said that the world was supported by a great elephant and when asked what the elephant rested on answered a great tortoise.",
            "Really all this means when said by either children or adults is that they dont know what it is and that the thing they purport to know and talk about isnt something of which they have any distinct idea at allthey are indeed perfectly in the dark about it.",
            "So the idea of ours to which we give the general name substance being nothing but the supposed but unknown support of those qualities we nd existing and which we imagine cant exist sine re substantethat is without some thing to support themwe call that support substantia which according to the true meaning of the word is in plain English standing under or upholding.",
            "From this we move on to having ideas of various sorts of substances which we form by collecting combinations of simple ideas that we nd in our ex perience tend to go together and which we therefore suppose to ow from the particular internal constitution or unknown essence of a substance.",
            "It is the combination of ordinary qualities observable in iron or a diamond that makes the true complex idea of those kinds of substanceskinds that a smith or a jeweller commonly 97 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances knows better than a philosopher does.",
            "So when we speak of any sort of substance we say it is a thing having such or such qualities body is a thing that is extended shaped and capable of motion spirit a thing that can think and we say that hardness and power to attract iron are qualities to be found in a loadstone conceived of as a thing containing these qualities.",
            "The latter is supposed without knowing what it is to be the substratum of those simple ideas that come to us from the outside and the former is supposed still not knowing what it is to be the substratum of the mental operations we experience within ourselves.",
            "So we shouldnt infer that there is no such thing as spirit because we have no notion of the substance of spirit any more than we should conclude that there is no such thing as body because we have no clear and distinct idea of the substance of matter.",
            "Anyone who hears such a word and understands the language forms in his mind a combination of those simple ideas that he has foundor thinks he has foundto exist together under that name all of which he supposes to rest in and be xed to that unknown common subject that doesnt inhere in anything else in its turn.",
            "Consider for instance the idea of the sun it is merely a collection of the simple ideas bright hot roundish having a constant regular motion at a certain distance from usand perhaps a few others depending on how accurately the owner of the idea has observed the 98 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances properties of the sun.",
            "Thirdly when we think that one substance can cause an alteration in the primary qualities of another so that the altered substance would produce in us different ideas from what it did before we speak of the active powers of the rst substance and the passive powers of the second.",
            "For example the power of being melted without being burned away and the power of being dissolved in aqua regia a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acidsthese ideas are as essential to our complex idea of 99 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances gold as are its colour and weight.",
            "These are both equally powers in the sun which operates on a manthrough the motion and shape of its sensible partsso as to make him have the idea of heat just as it operates on wax so as to make it capable of producing in a man the idea of white.",
            "If our senses were sharp enough to distinguish the minute particles of bodies and the real constitution on which their sensible qualities depend I am sure they would produce in us ideas quite different from the ones they now produce the yellow colour of gold for example would be replaced by an admirable texture of parts of a certain size and shape.",
            "Thus sand or ground glass which is opaque and white to the naked eye is transparent under a microscope and a hair seen this way loses its former colour and is mostly transparent with a mixture of bright sparkling colours like the ones refracted from a diamond.",
            "But if our senses were made much keener and more acute the surface appearances of things would be quite different for us and Im inclined to think that this would be inconsistent with our survivalor at least with our wellbeingin this part of the universe that we inhabit.",
            "Think about how little we are tted to survive being moved into air not much higher than the air we commonly breathethat will give you reason to be satised that on this planet that has been assigned as our home God has suited our organs to the bodies that are to affect them and vice versa.",

            "If someones eyesight the most instructive of our senses were a thousand or a hundred thousand times more acute than it is now through the best microscope he would be able to see with his naked eyes things several million times smaller than the smallest object he can see now and this would have a good result and a bad one.",
            "But if his eyes were so formed that he couldnt tell the time by his clock because he couldnt from a distance take in all at once the clockhand and the numerals on the dial he wouldnt get much advantage from the acuteness of his sight it would let him in on the structure and workings of the parts of the machine while also making it useless to him In section 13an admitted interruption of the main line of thoughtLocke remarks that the structure of our sense organs is what sets limits to what we can perceive in the material world and offers his extravagant conjecture about Spirits here meaning something like angels.",
            "Thus the idea that an Englishman signies by the name swan is white colour long neck red beak black legs and webbed feet and all these of a certain size with a power of swimming in the water and making a certain kind of noiseand perhaps other properties as well for someone who knows a lot about this kind of birdall united in one common subject.",

            "You cant imagine that your soul could think or move a body in Oxford while you are in London and you have to realize that your soul being united to your body continually changes its location during the whole journey between Oxford and London just as does the coach or horse that you ride onso I think it can be said to be truly in motion throughout that journey.",
            "If that isnt conceded as giving a clear idea enough of the souls motion you will get one from the thought of its being separated from the body in death for it seems to impossible that you should think of it as leaving the body while having no idea of its motion.",
            "Which of these is more obscure and harder to grasp I know that people whose thoughts are immersed in matter and have so subjected their minds to their senses that they seldom reect on anything that their senses cant reach are apt to say that they cant comprehend a thinking thing.",

            "The more success we have in showing that the parts of other bodies are held together by the external pressure of the ether and can have no other conceivable cause of their cohesion and union the more completely we are left in the dark about what holds together the parts of each particle of the ether itself.",
            "The surrounding uid is free to occupy each part of space that is deserted through such a lateral motion so it doesnt resist such a motion of bodies joined in that way any more than it would resist the motion of a body that was surrounded on all sides by that uid and didnt touch any other body.",
            "For the extendedness of body consists in nothing but the union and cohesion of its solid parts so we shall have a poor grasp of the extension of body when we dont understand the union and cohesion of its parts and we dont understand that any more than we understand what thinking is and how it is performed.",

            "In section 32 Locke starts by rehearsing the arguments he has given for the view that we have as much reason to be satised with our notion of immaterial spirit as with our notion of body and of the existence of the one as well as of the other.",
            "He then launches without announcing that he is doing so into a new issue is a human being an extended thing that thinks or rather a pair of things of which one is extended and the other thinks It is no 105 Essay II John Locke xxiii Ideas of substances more a contradiction that thinking should exist separate and independent from solidity than that solidity should exist separate and independent from thinking.",
            "If I nd that I know a few things some or all of them imperfectly I can form an idea of knowing twice as many which I can double again and so on indenitely just as I can generate an endless series of numbers by repeated doubling.",
            "Here is another bit of evidence that we are conned to the ideas that we receive from sensation and reection even if we think of unembodied Spirits as ever so much even innitely more advanced than bodies are we still cant have any idea of how they reveal their thoughts one to another.",
            "All our ideas of the various sorts of substances are nothing but collections of simple ideas together with a supposition 106 Essay II John Locke xxiv Collective ideas of something to which they belong and in which they exist though we have no clear distinct idea at all of this supposed something.",
            "He concludes All names that are more than empty sounds must signify some idea that either is an idea of a quality in the thing to which the name is applied and then it is positive and is looked on as united to and existing in the thing in question or arises from the respect or relation the mind nds the thing to bear to some other thing and then it includes a relation.",
            "Their parts are very often relative one to another but the whole considered together as one thing is a positive or absolute thing or idea it produces in us the complex idea of one thing and this idea is in our minds as one picture under one name even though it is an aggregate of different parts.",
            "Fourthly relation is thinking of one thing along with another so that any word is relative if it necessarily leads the mind to any ideas of qualities other than the ones that are supposed to exist in the thing to which the word is being applied.",
            "In section 4 not only measured time but also some other temporal descriptions are covertly relational for example old means one thing applied to a dog and another applied to a human being because calling a thing old is comparing its duration with the usual duration of things of that kind.",
            "Another context in which the mind compares things considers things together is their very being when we consider something as existing at a given time and place and compare it with itself existing at another time we are led to form the ideas of identity and diversity.",
            "When we see a thingany thing of whatever sortto be in a certain place at a certain time we are sure that it is that very thing and not another thing existing at that time in some other place however alike the two may be in all other respects.",
            "We never ndand cant even conceive oftwo things of the same kind existing in the same place at the same time so we rightly conclude that whatever exists in a certain place at a certain time excludes all others of the same kind and is there itself alone.",
            "So when we ask whether a thing is the same or not we are always referring to something that existed at a given time in a given place a thing that at that instant was certainly the same as itself and not the same as anything else.",
            "From this it follows that one thing cant have two beginnings of existence because it is impossible for one thing to be in different places at the same time and two things cant have one beginning because it is impossible for two things of the same kind to exist in the same instant at the very same place.",
            "There has been much enquiry after the principle of individuation but what I have said enables us easily to discover what that is it is existence itself which ties a being of a given sort to a particular time and place that cant be shared by any other being of the same kind.",
            "How then does an oak differ from a mass of matter The answer seems to me to be this the mass is merely the cohesion of particles of matter anyhow united whereas the 113 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity oak is such a disposition of particles as constitutes the parts of an oak and an organization of those parts that enables the whole to receive and distribute nourishment so as to continue and form the wood bark and leaves etc.",
            "Thus something is one plant if it has an organization of parts in one cohering body partaking of one common life and it continues to be the same plant as long as it partakes of the same life even if that life is passed along to new particles of matter vitally united to the living plant in a similar continued organization suitable for that sort of plants.",
            "This organization is at any one instant in some one collection of matter which distinguishes it from all others at that instant and what has the identity that makes the same plant is that individual life existing constantly from that mo ment forwards and backwards in the same continuity of imperceptibly succeeding parts united to the living body of the plant.",
            "If we suppose this machine to be one continued body whose parts were repaired added to or subtracted from by a constant addition or separation of imperceptible parts with one common life it would be very much like the body of an animal with the difference that in an animal the tness of the organization and the motion wherein life consists begin together because the motion comes from within but in a machine the force can be seen to come from outside and is often lacking even when the machine is in order and well tted to receive itfor example when a clock isnt wound up.",
            "To conceive and judge correctly about identity we must consider what idea the word it is applied to stands for it is one thing to be the same substance another the same man and a third the same person if person man and substance are names for three different ideas for such as is the idea belonging to that name such must be the identity.",
            "If this had been more carefully attended to it might have prevented a great deal of that confusion that often occurs regarding identity and especially personal identity to which 114 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity I now turn after one more section on same man.",
            "If we should see a creature of our own shape and physical constitution though it had no more reason all its life than a cat or a parrot we would still call him a man and anyone who heard a cat or a parrot talk reason and philosophize would still think it to be a cat or a parrot and would describe it as such.",
            "Given that it is the same person is it the same identical substance Most people would think that it is the same substance if these perceptions with their consciousness always remained present in the mind making the same thinking thing always consciously present and most people would think evidently the same to itself.",
            "Furthermore for the greatest part of our lives we dont reect on our past selves at all because we are intent on our present thoughts or in sound sleep have no thoughts at all or at least none with the consciousness that characterizes our waking thoughts.",
            "Different substances might all partake in a single conscious ness and thereby be united into one person just as different bodies can enter into the same life and thereby be united into one animal whose identity is preserved throughout that change of substances by the unity of the single continued life.",
            "But it is asked Can it be the same person if the substance changes and Can it be different persons if the same substance does the thinking throughout Before I address these questions in sections 13 and 14 theres a preliminary point I want to make.",
            "Unless they say that what makes the same life and thus the animal identity in lower animals is one immaterial spirit just as according to them one immaterial spirit makes the same person in menand Cartesians at least wont take that way out for fear of making the lower animals thinking things too.",
            "As to the rst question If the thinking substance is changed can it be the same person I answer that this can be settled only by those who know what kind of substances they are that think and whether the consciousness of past actions can be transferred from one such substance to an other.",
            "Admittedly if the same consciousness were the same 116 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity individual action it couldnt be transferred because in that case bringing a past headache say into ones consciousness would be bringing back that very headache and that is tied to the substance to which it occurred.",
            "How far the consciousness of past actions is tied to one individual agent so that another cant possibly have it will be hard for us to determine until we know what kind of action it is that cant be done without a reex act of perception accompanying it and how such an action is done by thinking substances who cant think without being conscious of it.",
            "He attacks them thereby attacking the separation of same person from same consciousness and proposes a thought experiment Reect on yourself and conclude that you have in yourself an immaterial spirit that is what thinks in you keeps you the same throughout the constant change of your body and is what you call myself.",
            "This isnt obviously absurd for souls as far as we know anything of their nature can go with any portion of matter as well as with any other so the soul or thinking substance that is now yourself may once really have been the soul of someone else such as Thersites or Nestor.",
            "If the soul of a prince carrying with it the consciousness of the princes past life were to enter and inform the body of a cobbler who has been deserted by his own soul everyone sees that he would be the same person as the prince accountable only for the princes actions but who would say it was the same man The body contributes to making the man and in this case I should think everyone would let the body settle the same man question not dissuaded from this by the soul with all its princely thoughts.",
            "Still when we want to explore what makes the same spirit man or person we must x the ideas of spirit man or person in our minds and when we have become clear about what we mean by them we shant nd it hard to settle for each of them when it is the same and when not.",
            "If my present consciousness that I am now writing were also a consciousness that I saw an overowing of the Thames last winter and that I saw Noahs ark and the ood I couldnt doubt that I who write this now am the same self that saw the Thames overowed last winter and viewed the ood at the general delugeplace that self in what substance you please.",
            "For sameness of substance is irrelevant to sameness of self I am as much involved inand as justly accountable foran action that was done a thousand years ago and is appropriated to me now by this selfconsciousness as I am for what I did a moment ago.",
            "If the nger were amputated and this consciousness went along with it deserting the rest of the body it is evident that the little nger would then be the person the same person and this self would then would have nothing to do with the rest of the body.",

            "That this is what people in general think can be seen in the most solemn declaration of their opinions human laws dont punish the madman for the sane mans actions or the sane man for what the madman did because they treat them as two persons.",
            "You may want to object But isnt a man drunk and sober the same person Why else is he punished for what he does when drunk even if he is never afterwards conscious of 119 Essay II John Locke xxvii Identity and diversity it He is just as much a single person as a man who walks in his sleep and is answerable while awake for any harm he did in his sleep.",
            "Human laws punish both with a justice suitable to the state of knowledge of those who administer the law in these cases they cant distinguish for sure what is real from what is counterfeit and so they dont allow the ignorance in drunkenness or sleep as a plea.",
            "Granted punishment is tied to personhood which is tied to consciousness and the drunkard may not be conscious of what he did but the courts justly punish him because his bad actions are proved against him and his lack of consciousness of them cant be proved for him.",
            "It may be reasonable to think that on the great day when the secrets of all hearts are laid open nobody will be held accountable for actions of which he knows nothing everybody will receive his sentence with his conscience agreeing with Gods judgment by accusing or excusing him.",
            "However every thinking being that can experience happiness or misery must grant that there is something himself that he is concerned for and wants to be happy and that this self has existed continuously for a period of time and therefore may exist for months and years to come with no set limit to its duration and thus may be the same self carried by consciousness into the future.",
            "Thus any part of my body while vitally united to that which is conscious in me is a part of myself for example my little nger while it relates to me in such a way that if it is damaged I feel pain but when the vital union is broken what was a part of myself a moment ago is now not so any more than a part of another mans self is a part of me.",

            "It would be utterly pointless for one thinking being to lay down a rule to govern the actions of another unless he had it in his power to reward compliance and punish deviation from his rule by some good or evil that isnt the natural consequence of the action itself.",
            "This is the only true touchstone of moral rectitude and it is by comparing their actions to this law that men judge the most considerable moral good or evil in their actionsthat is judge whether as duties or sins they are likely to procure them happiness or misery from the hands of God.",
            "Nobody ignores civil law because the rewards and punishments that enforce it are ready at hand and are suitable to the power that makes this law That is the force of the commonwealth which is obliged to protect the lives liberties and possessions of those who live according to its law and has the power to take away life liberty or goods from anyone who disobeys that being the punishment of 123 Essay II John Locke xxviii Other relations offences against this law.",

            "But whatever people say we can see that the names virtue and vice in particular instances of their use throughout the various nations and societies in the world are constantly attributed only to such actions as are in approved of or disapproved of in the country or society concerned.",
            "When men unite into political societies they hand over to the public the decisions about how their force is to be used so that they cant employ it against any fellowcitizens further than the law of the country directs but they hang onto the power of approving or disapproving of the actions of members of their society and by this approval and dislike they establish amongst themselves what they call virtue and vice.",
            "You will agree that this is the common measure of virtue and vice if you consider the fact that although what passes for vice in one country may be counted a virtue or at least not a vice in another yet everywhere virtue and praise go together as do vice and blame.",
            "Differences in personal character education fashion interests and so on can bring it about that what is thought praiseworthy in one place is censured in another and so in different societies virtues and vices may sometimes have exchanged places but in the main they have kept the same everywhere.",
            "Nothing can be more natural than to encourage with esteem and reputation what everyone nds to his advantage and to blame and discountenance the contrary and nothing so directly and visibly advances the general good of mankind in this world as obedience to the laws that God has set for them and nothing breeds such mischief and confusion as the neglect of those laws and so it is no wonder that esteem and discredit virtue and vice should to a large extent coincide with the unchangeable rule of right and wrong that the law of God has established.",
            "You might want to object When you say that the law by which men judge of virtue and vice is nothing but the consent of private men who havent enough authority to make a law you are forgetting your own notion of a law omitting something that according to you is necessary and essential to a law namely a power to enforce it.",
            "Someone who can content himself to live in constant disgrace and disrepute with his own particular society must have a strange and unusual constitution Many men have sought solitude and been reconciled to it but nobody who thinks at allnobody with the least sense of a man about himcan live in society under the constant dislike and poor opinion of his associates.",
            "We test the goodness of an action by relating it to a rule like testing the quality of gold by rubbing it against a touchstone the outcome of that test determines how we name the action and that name is the sign of what value we attribute to it.",
            "Whether we take the rule from the fashion of the country or from the will of a human or divine lawmaker the mind can easily see how a given action relates to it and so it has a notion of moral goodevil which is an actions conformitynonconformity to that rule and therefore is often called moral rectitude.",
            "This rule is merely a collection of several simple ideas so that to judge whether an action conforms to it one has only to organize ones thought of it so as to see whether the simple ideas belonging to it correspond to the ones that the law requires.",
            "Thus drunkenness and lying signify certain collections of simple ideas which I call mixed modes and understood in this way they are just as much positive absolute ideas with nothing relational and so nothing moral about them as are the drinking of a horse and the speaking of a parrot.",
            "Secondly our actions are considered as good bad or neither and this is a relational way of looking at them because what makes them regular or irregular good or bad is their conformity to or disagreement with some rule and the comparison with a rule puts them into the category of relation.",
            "But though the ideas of particular relations can be as clear and distinct in the minds of thoughtful people as those of mixed modes and more determinate than those of substances words expressing relations are often as doubtful and uncertain in their meanings as names of substances or mixed modes and much more than names of simple ideas.",
            "That is because a relational word is the mark of a comparison between two thingsan upshot of considering them togetherand this is something that occurs only in mens thoughts it is merely an idea in mens minds and it often happens that men apply a single relational word to different comparisons of things according to their own imaginations which dont always correspond with those of others using the same word.",

            "To remove this difculty and to help us to conceive correctly what the confusion is that ideas are sometimes accused of we should note that things brought under dif ferent names are supposed to be different enough to be distinguished from one another that so each sort can be marked off by its own special name and talked about as need arises separately from anything else.",
            "Now every idea that a man has is visibly what it is and is distinct from all other ideas so what makes it confused is its being such that it may as well be called by a name other than the one it is expressed by.",
            "A complex idea for they are the ones most liable to confusion may be made up of too few simple ideas containing only ideas all of which are common to other things as well in which case the idea leaves out the differences that entitle it to a different name.",
            "Another fault that makes our ideas confused occurs when although the particulars that make up a complex idea are numerous enough they are so jumbled that it isnt easy to see whether the idea belongs more properly to the name that is given it than to some other.",
            "The best way to understand this kind of confusion is to attend to a sort of pictures usually shown as surprising pieces of art in which the colours as they are laid by the pencil on the page itself mark out very odd and unusual gures with no discernible order in their layout.",
            "Someone who does this because he isnt sure what to include in and what to exclude from his idea of church or idolatry every time he thinks of either and doesnt hold steady to any one precise combination of ideas that makes it up is said to have a confused idea of idolatry or of the church.",
            "What I have said shows how much nameswhich are supposed to be steady signs of things and through their differences to keep different things distinct in our mindsare the occasion for labelling ideas as distinct or confused through the minds secretly and covertly relating its ideas to such names.",
            "But this exactness is rather to be wished for than to be expected because it is laborious and requires selfcriticism and it doesnt serve any purpose except the discovery of naked truth which isnt everyones goal And since the loose Application of names to undetermined variable and almost no ideas serves both to cover our own ignorance and to perplex and confound otherswhich counts as learning and superiority in knowledgeit is no wonder that most men should engage in such faults themselves while complaining of it in others.",

            "He can talk about and do proofs concerning that part of his complex idea that depends on the number which may lead him to think that he has a distinct idea of a chiliahedron yet he plainly doesnt have a precise idea of its shape that would enable him to distinguish a chiliahedron by its shape from a gure that has only 999 sides.",
            "But he cant possibly include in his idea of any duration however great the whole extent of a duration in which he supposes no end so the part of his idea that reaches beyond the bounds of that large duration he represents to his own thoughtsthat is beyond the largest duration that he represents clearlyis very obscure and undetermined.",
            "But though whiteness and coldness are no more in snow than pain is yet the ideas of whiteness and coldness as well as of pain are effects in us of powers in things outside us they are real ideas in us through which we distinguish the qualities that are really in things themselves.",
            "How can 131 Essay II John Locke xxx Real and fantastical ideas it happen that one mans idea of gold or of justice is different from anothers It can only be because one has included or omitted from his complex idea some simple idea that the other has not.",
            "On the other side those are fantastical that are made up of collections of simple ideas of qualities that were never really united never found together in any substancesuch as a rational creature consisting of a horses head joined to a body of human shape or a body that is yellow malleable fusible and xed easily volatilized but lighter than common water or a uniform unstructured body that is capable of per ception and voluntary motion.",
            "Whether such substances can exist we dont know but we should count the ideas of them as merely imaginary because they dont conform to any pattern existing that we know and consist of collections of ideas of qualities that no substance has ever shown us united together.",
            "They are nothing but the effects of certain powers in things that are t and ordained by God to produce such sensations in us so they must correspond to and be adequate to those powers and we are sure they agree with the reality of things.",
            "Thus because each sensation corresponds to the power that operates on our senses the idea so produced is a real idea and not a ction of the mind which has no power to produce any simple idea and it cannot but be adequate since it ought only to correspond to that power.",
            "The res power of producing in us the idea of pain we correctly report by saying that the re is painful to the touch but we handle differently its power to cause in us ideas of light and heat saying that the re itself is bright and is hot as though light and heat were not merely ideas in us but qualities in or of the re.",

            "When the mind has acquired an idea that it thinks it may be useful in thought or in talk the rst thing it does is to abstract it and then get a name for it and so tuck it away in its storehouse the memory as containing the essence of a sort of things of which that name is always to be the mark.",

            "Locke goes on to expand this point a little concluding thus The name blue stands for that mark of distinction that is in a violet and that we can discern only through our eyes whatever it ultimately consists in that beingperhaps fortunatelybeyond our capacities to know in detail.",
            "Simple ideas wouldnt be convicted of falsity if through the different structure of our senseorgans it happened that one object produced in different mens minds different ideas at the same timefor example if the idea that a violet produced in one mans mind by his eyes were what a marigold produced in another mans and vice versa.",
            "Though in compliance with the ordinary way of speaking I have shown in what sense and for what reason an idea may be called true or false if we look more closely we nd that in all those cases what is really true or false is some judgment that the mind makes or is supposed to make.",
            "Secondly falsehood occurs when the mind having a complex idea made up of a collection of simple ones such as nature never puts together judges it to t a species of creatures really existingfor example joining the weight of tin to the colour fusibility and xedness of gold.",
            "Thirdly there is falsehood when the mind makes a complex idea that unites some simple ideas of qualities that do really exist together in some sort of thing while omitting others that are inseparable from the rst lot and judges this to be a perfect complete idea of a sort of things which really it is not.",
            "For example having joined the ideas of substance yellow malleable most heavy and fusible the mind takes that to be the complete idea of gold when really golds xedness and solubility in aqua regia are as inseparable from those other ideas or qualities as they are from one another.",
            "To conclude a man has no notion of anything external to himself except through the idea he has of it in his mind he is free to call the idea whatever he pleases and to make an idea that neither ts the reality of things nor agrees to the idea commonly signied by other peoples words but he cant make a wrong or false idea of a thing that is known to him only through his idea of it.",
            "Men of fair minds not prone to extravagant selfattery are frequently guilty of it and in many cases one hears the arguments of such a man with amazement astonished at the obstinacy of a worthy man who doesnt yield to the evidence of reason even when it is laid before him as clear as daylight.",
            "Upbringing is often rightly assigned as the cause and prejudice is a good general name for the thing itself but you need to dig deeper if you want to trace this sort of madness to the root from which it comes explaining it in a way that will show how this aw originates in sober and rational minds and what it consists in.",
            "You will pardon my calling it by so harsh a name as madness when you reect that opposition to reason deserves that name and really is madness and almost everyone has it severely enough to act or argue in some kinds of cases 141 Essay II John Locke xxxiii Association of ideas in ways which if they spread throughout his life would make him a candidate for a madhouse rather than for polite society.",
            "There is also another connection of ideas arising wholly from chance or custom ideas that have no kinship in themselves come to be so strongly linked in some mens minds that it is very hard to separate them as soon as one comes into the understanding its associate appears too and if more than two are thus united the whole inseparable group show themselves together.",
            "The habitual bodily movements at the most basic level seem to be movements of the animal spirits once these are started up they continue in the ways they have been used to and when these have been trodden for long enough they are worn into smooth paths along which the motion becomes easy and seemingly natural.",
            "A musician who is used to a particular tune will nd that as soon at it begins in his head the ideas of its notes will follow on in due order in his understanding without any care or attention on his part as regularly as his ngers move in the right order over the keys of the organ to play the tune he has begun while his mind is on something else.",
            "Early childhood is the time most susceptible to lasting impressions and although discreet people attend to impressions that could harm the health of the body and protect the young against them those that could harm the mind and have their effects in the understanding or the passions have been much less heeded than they deserve.",
            "There is no way of reasoning the woman out of her tie between the thought of the child and the thought of her loss of pleasure but the two thoughts may be separated by 143 Essay II John Locke xxxiii Association of ideas the passing of time through which the tie is weakened by disuse.",
            "Let the ideas of being and of matter be strongly joined either by education or by prolonged thought and while they are tied together in a persons mind what thoughts and arguments will he put up concerning unembodied Spirits Because in this persons thought the idea of something real always brings with it the idea of something material he will regard the notion of unembodied Spiritsomething real and immaterialas weird and almost contradictory.",
            "Let someone from early childhood associate the idea of God with the idea of shape and what absurdities will he be liable to believe concerning the Deity Let the idea of infallibility be inseparably joined in some ones mind to the idea of some person and the man whose mind has this association will swallow any absurdity that is afrmed by the supposedly infallible personfor example that a single body can be in two places at once.",
            "Some such wrong and unnatural combinations of ideas will be found at the root of the irreconcilable opposition between different sects of philosophy and religion for we cant imagine that every follower of a sect deliberately sets himself to reject knowingly truth that is offered by plain reason.",
            "We must allow that at least some of them do what they all claim to do namely to pursue truth sincerely so there must be something that blinds the understandings of these sectarians not letting them see the falsehood of what they embrace as real truth.",
            "What thus puts their reasons in chains and leads men blindfolded away from common sense turns out to be my present topic Some ideas that are not naturally allied to one an other areby upbringing custom and the constant din of the sectso joined in the sectarians minds that they always appear there together and the sectarians can no more separate them in their thoughts than if they were only a single ideawhich is what they treat them as being.",
            "But now that I have reached it I nd that ideas are so closely connected with words and in particular that abstract ideas are so regularly related to general words that it is impossible to speak clearly and distinctly of our knowledge which all 144 Essay II John Locke xxxiii Association of ideas consists in propositions without considering rst the nature use and meanings of language."
